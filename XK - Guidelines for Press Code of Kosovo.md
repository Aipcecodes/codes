This guide that deals with print journalism is drafted specifically for purposes of self-regulation of print media and their editorial offices to improve ethic level of reporting and also the quality and credibility of the journalism. The Code’s guide is based on Kosovo’s media practice, in national and international legislation.

2. **Reporting of crime**

Victims of crime of different charges or accidents have the right to save their identities,  except in the cases when it is a public interest, and the public needs to be thoroughly  informed on the event. If the investigation, charges, or court verdict has been part of any  article or news then the case should be followed until it is closed. The journalist in a  particular way has to be careful not to publish the identity of a minor. Family members or  other relatives’ identity of the suspect or sentenced person should be saved, except the cases  when they are accomplices. When reporting the crime, religion and ethnicity of the suspect  should not be mentioned, apart when the information is important for the public opinion to  fully understand the event.

3. **Protection of children and minors**

Media are obliged to act in accordance with the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of  the Child and the Kosovo legislation. Media need to have the permission of parents or tutors  to interview, take videos or pictures of children under the age of 18. Media will not identify  children under the age of 16, if they are involved in criminal acts as witness or defendant.  Media will not interview, disturb, take pictures or videos of children in school or near it  without having the permission of administrators of school.

4. **Privacy**

Media should not take pictures of people in  private environments without having their permission, apart the cases when there is public  interest \* for such a matter.

5. **Copyright**

Media are allowed to refer only to the main information of the original article if they draw a  new article, on the condition that they give a clear reference to the medium they are referring. Media should not publish the whole published material from other publishers, without prior  permission of the first publisher. There is an exception for this rule when the publisher  provides with clause or any other way that the published material can be republished without  asking for permission. Media should not take photographs or videos from other medium  without prior permission of the first publisher. In all cases of republishing, media are obliged  to cite the first publisher of the content.

6. **Protection of sources**

The court can require from the defendant to reveal the relevant information in order to define the truthfulness of the published content, however without identifying the source. 
    
**Defamation** implies publication of a false fact or declaration, for which the publisher knows or ought to have known that this fact or declaration was false and the meaning of it damages the reputation of another person. 
    
**Insult** implies the statement, behaviour and publication of the declaration toward a person which is humiliating.

7. **Right of reply**

If media find that they have published an article that contains false facts, they will publish the  correction in the nearest time. If media find that they have published an incorrect article, which has risked the reputation of any person or institution, they will apologize in the nearest  time. Media will draw the publication of correction, reaction or refutation in a visible place  on newspapers’ pages, or in the page set by their editorial office for their publication. If the  answer or reaction is not convenient for publication, the changes that the editorial office  requires will be discussed with the sender. If they do not reach an agreement, then it is  advisable to publish the main content of the response, omitting inappropriate parts (insults,  defamation, etc) that are in compliance with Press Code of Kosovo. If it is not possible to  publish the statements of both pairs in the same article, then the one that has not been  published for different reasons will be done as soon as possible. Media will publish the  comment of the other part as well.
   
8. **Differences between informative and advertising content**

Advertisements in the pages of print media, which are paid by sponsors, should certainly be distinguished from informative content and should be published in the way that the reader can  differ them as such.  Media and journalists have to be careful to distinguish professional reporting from advertisements in order to avoid any conflict of interest.

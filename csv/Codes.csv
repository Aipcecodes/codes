<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Code of Ethics is a self-regulating instrument which aims to guide, strengthen and improve the quality of journalism and the sense of responsibility of journalists in Albania.</p>
<p>The principles of this Code are in line with the universal ethical values of journalism, which are widely recognized and accepted by media organizations and journalism unions in democratic countries. They are a cornerstone of democratic pluralism and also respect the spirit of the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<h2>The Role of Media in Society</h2>
<p>Freedom of speech, freedom of information and criticism, freedom of the press, and access to official documents are basic elements of a democratic society.</p>
<p>Media play an extraordinarily important role in society, by providing reliable and timely news and information in various forms and through assorted platforms. The media serve as watchdogs, holding centers of power to account and constantly monitoring government authorities and organizations, institutions and businesses. Media play a fundamental role in the democratic processes and provide ample opportunities and a safe environment to allow journalists to perform their duties independently.</p>
<p>The media recognize the importance of pluralism in society and respect the diversity of opinions, opposing all discrimination based on sex, race, nationality, language, religion, ideology, culture, class, conviction, or any other cause.</p>
<p>The media recognize and defend both its rights and duties versus the public, constantly preserving the balance between them.</p>
<h2>The Scope of the Code</h2>
<p>The following regulations concerning conduct shall apply to all persons and organizations engaging in the gathering, editing, preparation and dissemination of journalistic information. The scope of the Code shall cover the individual and collective supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.</p>
<p>The Code refers to individual and collective responsibilities in the supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.</p>
<p>The principles of this Code apply equally to all media and journalistic platforms, offline and online, including journalism disseminated through social media and internet portals.</p>
<p>The Code of Ethics presumes and expects that all media organizations and journalists recognize and accept the voluntary principles set out in this Code. All those who engage in journalism are invited to acknowledge and accept the following principles as necessary to the well-being of journalism and freedom of expression in Albania.</p>
<p>Journalists who knowingly violate the principles of this code betray the trust of the public and may not expect the support and solidarity of their colleagues, media organizations or journalism trade unions. Controversies arising from alleged violations of the Code are dealt with through transparent systems of voluntary self-regulation developed by journalists and news media organizations that may operate at the level of the enterprise and across different platforms of the news media industry.</p>
<h3>1. Accuracy and Fairness of Information</h3>
<p>Journalists have the right to seek information and the right of access to public information. They have the right to publish and to criticize.</p>
<p>Journalists and news media shall at all times strive to publish information that is to the best of their knowledge truthful, balanced and verified.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>A journalist must verify information prior to its publication in order to ensure that it is accurate, fact-based and trustworthy. All data and information must be subject to careful scrutiny: whether it is obtained from human sources or documents.</p>
<p>Journalists should always indicate where information has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Media should not mislead the public. They should clearly indicate where manipulated texts, documents, images and sounds have been used.</p>
<p>Media shall not publish any photos, image, audio, or visual arrangements that distort the ideas or facts of the source, with the exception of caricatures, cartoons or comic plots.</p>
<p><strong>Unbiased Journalism</strong></p>
<p>Journalists shall strive to provide unbiased and balanced reporting. Journalists shall refer to all available sources and interested parties that can provide useful and relevant information.
In reporting on a controversy, journalists should be inclusive and seek to ensure that all parties concerned have an opportunity to state their position.
Criticized parties shall have the right to respond to accusations, whenever possible in the same publication. Journalists shall make every effort to contact all sides and gather all relevant opinions. Mere contacts with both sides do not “release' a journalist from the obligation to present both sides of a story, and to report as truthfully as possible.
The principle of “presenting all sides' may not apply in publications representing personal opinions (editorials, opinion pieces) as well as reports of a factual nature, such as reporting on public meetings or events.</p>
<h3>2. Distinguishing Fact from Opinion</h3>
<p>Media must distinguish clearly between opinion and comments and fact-based reporting. Columnist, caricaturists, and critics are allowed to present their opinions on individuals and events. News relates to information supported by facts and data, while an opinion piece contains and represents ideas, opinions and considerations of journalists, editors and publishers.</p>
<h3>3. Rectification and Reply</h3>
<p>Media shall be open to engage with their audience and to deal with legitimate comments and complaints.</p>
<p>Media should publish a clear and appropriately prominent correction when it can be demonstrated that inaccurate or misleading information has been published. Media should provide an apology and appropriate remedy where it is necessary.</p>
<p>A criticized party shall always have the right of response.</p>
<p>If the reply is not fit for publication as such, changes to it should be discussed with the writer. If he or she cannot be contacted within a reasonable time, the reply may be published in amended form. However, its essential contents must not be changed.</p>
<h3>4. Relations with Sources</h3>
<p>Journalists shall strive to gather information from all available sources in order to provide accurate, complete, and impartial information.</p>
<p>Journalists shall be transparent in their work and use methods for gathering information that are ethical and lawful.</p>
<p>A person being interviewed has the right to know in which medium and in what connection statements will be used.</p>
<p>Journalists shall exercise care in the selection of sources and establish clear working relations with them to make sure that the information they receive is correct.</p>
<p>Media shall exercise particular care in dealing with sources who are members of vulnerable groups, such as children and young people, victims of violence or minorities.</p>
<p>Media shall not distort or misuse statements made in a specific context. In particular consideration should be shown towards people who cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have.</p>
<p>Journalists shall not divulge the name of a person when information is provided on a confidential basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.</p>
<p>The right to the anonymity may be broken only if:</p>
<p>a) There is suspicion that the source consciously has distorted truth or is seeking to manipulate media for personal gain;</p>
<p>b) The reference to the name of the source is the only way to avoid serious and inevitable damage to others;</p>
<p>c) The information in question relates to the planning of a serious criminal act or is of major concern for public welfare.</p>
<p>If unjustly denied access to requested information, a journalist has the right to inform the general public about it.</p>
<h3>5. Editorial independence</h3>
<p>Media shall avoid unacceptable conflicts of interest and shall not permit any undue influence arising from personal beliefs, political or financial incentives to affect the accurate and impartial reporting of their journalists and work of editorial departments.</p>
<p>Journalists, publishers, and media owners must resist threats, provocations, or incentives to influence, distort or conceal information. They shall not use any information or data collected during their job for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>Editorial content should be clearly distinguished from marketing, advertisements, materials prepared by political parties or other institutions/organizations, or sponsored content. Sponsored content must clearly show the identity of the sponsor.</p>
<p>Commercial and political advertising, as well as sponsored content – including articles and supplements – shall be labeled accordingly to ensure the media audience can distinguish them from editorial content.</p>
<h3>6. Pre-publication Agreement</h3>
<p>Journalists who agree not to publish a piece of information or material for a given period of time must respect these arrangements. Such an agreement (embargo) should be considered null and void if the information is published by another party, or when the person who requested the embargo in any way violates terms and conditions of the agreement reached between parties.</p>
<p>In the interests of fairness and accuracy journalists may show their news stories to interested parties prior to publication, but they shall not grant a veto on the right to publish and shall be free to decide for themselves on what suggestions they should take under consideration.</p>
<h3>7. Liability after Publication</h3>
<p>The publisher and editor are liable and responsible for the publication of news articles as well as letters to the editor, comments and replies published on the media website including where the name of the author is omitted or signed under an alias.</p>

<p>Any incorrect or false information that intentionally or unintentionally may cause harm to the image and reputation of another person constitutes a breach of human dignity.</p>

Only the protection of the public interest can justify journalistic investigations which interfere with the private aspects of the lives of individuals. Journalists shall only make reference to personal or private aspects of people's lives when they are relevant.</p>
<p>Journalists will use fair methods in the collection of information. They only make use of subterfuge, hidden cameras, microphones or other special equipment, or obscure their professional identity, in circumstances where:</p>

<p>b) The information is of urgent and serious concern to the public</p>

"03_AT";"Austria";"AT";"Guiding Principles for Journalistic Activities (Code of Ethics for the Austrian Press)";"<h1>Guiding Principles for Journalistic Activities (Code of Ethics for the Austrian Press)</h1>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Journalism requires freedom and responsibility. Newspaper publishers and editors, broadcasting and television managers, as well as journalists have particular responsibility for maintaining the freedom of the mass media, which is a vitally important element of democratic life.</p>
<p>This is a special challenge for the heads of editorial offices, who have to ensure the consistent respect of the principles that should guide the work of journalists under their authority.</p>
<p>The Austrian Press Council (Österreichischer Presserat) is the platform for all those who support the idea that the use of the freedom of the press should be guided by the principles of truthfulness and accuracy, and who are willing to submit their products, in concrete cases, to the scrutiny of the Press Council. Voluntary self-regulation on a permanent basis is an appropriate means to ensure that the press meets its responsibility.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the Austrian Press Council has laid down the following catalogue of principles (Code of Ethics for the Austrian Press) for all those who are engaged on behalf of newspaper in the gathering, dissemination and commenting of the news. This catalogue can be supplemented or interpreted by guidelines as and when needed. The principles stated below shall hold for all those parts of a publication, which are under the editors' responsibility.</p>
<p>Newspaper and magazines that commit themselves to compliance with the principles of this Code of Ethics undertake to publish every and any finding of the Austrian Press Council directed against said newspaper or magazine and the publication of which the Council has required (signet in their imprint).</p>
<h3>1. Freedom</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Freedom of news reporting and commenting, be it in words or in pictures, forms an integral part of the freedom of press. There shall be no restrictions regarding the collection and dissemination of news and comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Press Council and its activities, the limits to this freedom are set by the journalists' voluntary self-regulation based on the provision of this Code of Ethics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Accuracy</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the prime duty of journalists to aim at a maximum of conscientiousness and accuracy in their investigations, the presentation of news items, and comments in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quotes between quotation marks shall reflect the tenor as detailed as possible, and no quotation marks shall be used for passages, which merely render the generic sense of a statement. Quoting from anonymous sources should be avoided unless anonymity is required in the interest of the safety of the person quoted or in order to protect such person from some other serious disadvantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No charges shall be made against any person(s) or institution(s) unless proof can be furnished that an attempt has been made to obtain a statement on said charges form the person(s) or institution(s) so charged. If the charge in question has been made in public, this circumstance shall be clearly indicated, and the source of said charge shall be named.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as an editorial office is advised of the fact that it has published a wrong statement, professional ethics and common decency demand that a correction of a said statement be published voluntarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any justified statement on the part of a reader or readers calling for correction of a report shall be published as soon as possible and as extensive as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adequate coverage shall be given to any important court decision or finding of another public authority regarding a subject on which the newspaper or magazine has reported or to any essential new findings concerning said subject that have emerged in some other way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Distinctive Character of Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Readers shall be left in no doubts as to whether a newspaper item is a factual report, the reproduction of the views of a third party or third parties, or comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of serious doubts about the correctness of a quotation, the validity of third-party statements shall be checked before said statements are reproduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photomontages and picture material that has been modified shall be clearly marked as such if a cursory reading might otherwise lead the reader to believe them to be documentary in nature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Influence</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Form and content of contributions to the editorial sections of a newspaper or magazine shall on no account be influenced by outside interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such improper influence shall be deemed to comprise not only interventions or pressure that is brought to bear on a journalist but also the granting of personal advantages relative to matters that lie outside the immediate realm of the journalist's professional work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who accepts, in the context of his/her work as a journalist, presents or any other personal advantages likely to influence the journalistic product shall be deemed to have breached this Code of Ethics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The publishers' economic interests shall not affect editorial content in any way that might result in wrong information or the suppression of important information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a journalist publishes a report on a journey, which has been paid for by a third party, this fact shall be mentioned in the report in a suitable way.</p>
</li>

<p>The Standards of Practice comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Statement of General Principles;</li>
<li>the Statement of Privacy Principles;</li>
<li>a series of Specific Standards of Practice, which apply the two Statements of Principles to particular aspects of media practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council Advisory Guidelines may also be taken into account but are not binding Standards.</p>
<p>The Standards of Practice apply to text, headlines, photographs, graphics, captions, audio, video and all other forms of published material, but not to advertising.</p>
<p>Publishers and editors are responsible for taking reasonable steps to comply with the Standards in their print and online publications. This applies to actions by their employees and external contributors, including those who are not journalists.</p>
<p>Publisher members are also obliged under the Council Constitution to cooperate with its handling of complaints. This includes publishing all Council adjudications relating to their particular publications.</p>
<h3>Preamble to the General Principles</h3>
<p>In a democratic society, all people have the right to freedom of expression and to be informed. These rights cannot be secured unless the press is free to publish facts and opinions without fear or favour.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press, however, carries responsibilities to the public. Liberty does not mean licence, and due regard must be given to other important freedoms, rights and values which are in the public interest.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Press Council has laid down the following General Principles to which all publisher members are committed by the Council Constitution.</p>
<h2>The General Principles</h2>
<p>Publications are free to publish as they wish by reporting facts and expressing opinions, provided they take reasonable steps to comply with the following Principles and the Council other Standards of Practice.</p>
<h3>Accuracy and clarity</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that factual material in news reports and elsewhere is accurate and not misleading, and is distinguishable from other material such as opinion.</li>
<li>Provide a correction or other adequate remedial action if published material is significantly inaccurate or misleading.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fairness and balance</h3>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Ensure that factual material is presented with reasonable fairness and balance, and that writers' expressions of opinion are not based on significantly inaccurate
factual material or omission of key facts.</li>
<li>Ensure that where material refers adversely to a person, a fair opportunity is given for subsequent publication of a reply if that is reasonably necessary to address a possible breach of General Principle 3.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Privacy and avoidance of harm</h3>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>Avoid intruding on a person's reasonable expectations of privacy, unless doing so
is sufficiently in the public interest.</li>
<li>Avoid causing or contributing materially to substantial offence, distress or
prejudice, or a substantial risk to health or safety, unless doing so is sufficiently in
the public interest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Integrity and transparency</h3>
<ol start=""7"">
<li>Avoid publishing material which has been gathered by deceptive or unfair means,
unless doing so is sufficiently in the public interest.</li>
<li>Ensure that conflicts of interests are avoided or adequately disclosed, and that
they do not influence published material.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Explanatory notes</h3>
<p>“Person” includes a group or category of people (provided it is reasonably specific and limited in number)
and a corporation or other legal entity.
“Sufficiently in the public interest”: The necessary level of justification in the public interest is
proportionate to the gravity of the potential breach of the Principles. Relevant factors to consider may
include, for example, the importance in the public interest of:
(a) ensuring everyone has genuine freedom of expression and access to reliable information;
(b) protecting and enhancing independent and vigorous media; public safety and health; due
administration of justice and government, personal privacy, and national security;
(c) exposing or preventing crime, dishonesty and serious misconduct or incompetence (especially by
public figures).</p>"

<h3>PRINCIPLE 1: To serve the truth, accuracy and objectiveness</h3>
<ol>
<li>The primary goal of journalism is dissemination of truth; and objectiveness is a main professional criteria.</li>
<li>Journalists shall study and convey the viewpoint held by the target of criticism in their articles. If this is not possible and if the target of criticism requires so, the journalist shall create due conditions for such persons to communicate their views. The principle of pluralism shall be upheld. </li>
<li>Opinions in articles shall be expressed in a way that readers could differentiate them from news and facts; and attribute such opinions to the journalist. </li>
</ol>
<h3>PRINCIPLE 2: Respectful approach towards sources of information</h3>
<ol>
<li>The source must always be indicated while disseminating official information from organizations, parties, societies, unions and other interest groups. However, if the person who provides the information prefers to remain anonymous, journalists or media entities must adhere to his/her privacy conditions. The confidentiality of the source of information shall be protected.</li>
<li>The information provided by unofficial sources shall be checked for its authenticity and informative value before being disseminated. The content of the information shall not be distorted while being prepared for print. When quoting from another article or speech, journalists should note precise starting and ending points of the quotation. When printing photo-symbols (illustration, photo-editing) together with texts, it should be noted that such images do not have documentary importance. Titles of articles should correspond to their content.</li>
<li>Journalist should try to have his/her interview signed by interviewees or their authorized agents. If this is not possible, interviewees should be notified of the way in which the interview will be published and whether the questions asked by the journalist will be modified.</li>
<li>If there are no other methods available, journalists may use special equipment (hidden cameras, hidden microphones or other hidden tools) or methods ('fake' IDs and etc) as an exception for obtaining information that has public importance.</li>
<li>Journalists shall not resort to intimidation, application of force or threats in order to obtain information or images.</li>

<li>Journalists should respect the right to presumption of innocence of persons who are suspected of committing crimes and should introduce such persons not as criminals, but as persons who have been detained for being suspected of committing crimes. </li>

<li>If a person is charged with committing of a crime, journalists shall not prepare reports which could undermine the objectiveness of the court in this issue and opinions from all involved parties should be reflected in such reports. If victims of a crime have not given their consent to be identified, journalists shall treat the identities of such individuals with sensitivity. This rule is especially important in cases involving sexual assault. If witnesses have not consented to being identified and if their identification does not have any public importance, journalists shall treat their identity with sensitivity.</li>
<li>Journalists shall refrain from glorifying or unnecessarily sensational reporting about crime, violence, brutality and suicide. Journalists shall be careful not to be used as a means by those who promote, incite or use violence; instead, journalists shall report on their activities with due constraint and only if there is a clear public interest.</li>
<li>Journalists or editorials should not prepare reports that exaggerate terror acts; reports that serve the interests of terrorists; reports that create fear or those which promote or justify terror acts. </li>

</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this Code, information ‘of public interest' should not be confused with information which is ‘interesting to the public'.</p>
<p>A publication is in the public interest only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It protects health, safety and security;</li>

<h3>FOUNDING PRINCIPLES</h3>
<p>The right to information and the freedom of expression are both fundamental human rights and essential conditions for a democratic society.</p>
<p>It is both the right and the duty of the press to inform the public about issues of general concern.</p>
<p>The public's right to know the facts and the opinions determines the freedom of the press and its responsibility. </p>
<p>The journalist's obligation to the public presumes a maximum of freedom and takes precedence over the obligations of the journalist to his/her employer or government.</p>
<p>The journalist is duty bound to respect human rights and to self-impose high standards regards to: (I) to report information truthfully and faithfully (II) gathering and sharing information independently (III) to be fair and (IV) to show respect for privacy and human dignity.</p>
<p>This code covers all forms of journalism, regardless of the medium.</p>
<p>The journalist may deviate from this code if it is very much in the public interest and if the information cannot be collected and conveyed in any other manner. The provisions to which this is applicable are hereafter marked by (*).</p>
<p>Media are accessible to the public and therefore identify themselves. They provide sufficient information to contact them.</p>
<p>A number of the provisions in this code are supplemented with concrete guidelines. These provisions are hereafter marked</p>
<h3>I. FAITHFUL REPORTING</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The journalist must report information faithfully. This comes from the public's right to know the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist must publish only information of which the source is known to him and must check the truthfulness of said information, even if this causes a delay. Where possible and when relevant, he must provide the source of said information.</p>

<p>The journalist must distinguish clearly for the public between his factual reporting and his commentary.
The journalist must distinguish clearly between facts on the one hand and suppositions, claims, and opinions on the other hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commentaries, opinion pieces, columns or cartoons offer the journalist more scope to give his opinion and to draw conclusion from the facts than is the case in factual reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist must always promptly rectify any relevant factual inaccuracies or distortions reported by him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist always offers the other party a chance to respond, to correct factual information or to add to it. A request to respond can only be refused for serious reasons.</p>

<li>
<p>The journalist and his editors enjoy maximum freedom of information, of commentary, and of criticism, and they must exercise these freedoms responsibly.</p>

<p>The journalist must avoid conflicts of interest with persons or organisations with which he comes into professional contact.</p>

</li>
<li>

<h2>Guidelines for using the code of practice</h2>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 3. EDITING OF SOUND AND IMAGES AND THE USE OF ARCHIVE MATERIAL</h3>
<p><em>Art. 3. The journalist does not omit or change any essential information in texts, images, audio(visual) recordings or other documents. When processing interviews, he must faithfully report the interviewee's statements and respect the spirit of the conversation.</em></p>
<p>Any editing of images that changes the journalistic content of an image or of a document must be clearly identifiable for the viewer/reader, who may not be misled in any fashion. If not immediately clear that the image has been edited, the caption or accompanying text must clearly indicate that the image or sound has been edited. If images or audio(visual) recordings are edited in such a way that they no longer portray what the camera or microphone actually recorded, it must be made clear to the viewer in the accompanying commentary or text. Reconstructions or events acted out are included under this guideline.</p>
<p>Archive material must always be labelled as such if the use of said material could be misleading for the audience.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 6. CORRECTIONS OF ONLINE PUBLICATIONS</h3>
<p><em>Art. 6 The journalist must always promptly rectify any relevant factual inaccuracies or distortions reported by him.</em></p>
<p>If serious mistakes have been made in online reporting, it is not enough to remove the article or to update it, but the journalist needs to acknowledge the mistake and publish a rectification.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 9. EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
<p><em>Art. 9. The journalist and the editors maintain their independence and resist any pressure. The journalist need accept only editorial guidelines from those in charge of editing. The journalist has the right to refuse any and all assignments that do not agree with journalistic ethics or the code of practise.</em></p>
<p>The editor in chief or the person undertaking the editorial tasks is responsible for the total journalistic product. He guards over the journalistic independence and the integrity of the editorial office so that the guidelines and code for correct professional conduct and journalistic ethics may be upheld.</p>
<p>The editor in chief is also the most appropriate point of contact for the commercial and advertorial departments. It is the task of the editor-in-chief to guarantee the editorial independence and to ensure commercial activities do not impinge on the editorial freedom.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 12. THE FINANCING OF JOURNALISTIC ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p><em>Art. 12. The journalist does not accept any assignments nor benefits that compromise his independence or the independence of his editorial office.</em></p>
<p>In principle, journalistic activities are paid for by the editorial office and responsibility remains with the editor-in-chief.</p>
<ul>
<li>When third parties carry exceptional costs or offer particular services for the journalistic tasks in hand, the journalist and the editor in chief guarantee the journalistic independence.</li>
<li>Whenever there is a risk that the journalist's credibility may be seen by the public to be affected, the journalist is transparent about the external financing or support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 13. TRADE WITH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, THE MANIPULATION OF MARKETS, INVESTMENT ADVICE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h3>
<p><em>Art. 13. The journalist may not use financial information, of which he has knowledge and prior to its publication, for personal gain or in the interest of those in his surroundings. A journalist must remain free of any form of abuse of prior knowledge or market manipulation.</em></p>
<p>There is a particular guideline regarding trade with prior knowledge, market manipulation, investment advice and conflicts of interest. (See www.rvdj.be/journalistieke-code)</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 14. OPINION PIECES</h3>
<p><em>Art. 14. Editors are free to decide which opinion pieces they publish or broadcast. The responsibility for the content of these letters/opinion pieces remains with the author(s) thereof.</em></p>
<p>Editors are free to add a postscript to letters and other reactions sent in, not to publish them or to remove them. Changes and/or truncation are permitted provided the message and the tone are kept. </p>
<p>Editors must moderate their web forums and social media with complete independence and are responsible for said moderation. It is their responsibility to avoid or to remove unsuitable content as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A journalist is not responsible for opinions by third parties. But when he knows that an opinion piece by a third party, which he publishes, contains relevant and manifest factual errors, he makes this clear to the public.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 15. DEALING WITH MINORS</h3>
<p><em>Art. 15. The journalist must employ only staunch methods in acquiring and processing information, audio(visual) recordings and documents.</em> *</p>
<p>The journalist may not abuse his position, especially in regard to persons in a vulnerable situation such as minors, victims of crime, of disasters and accidents and those closest to them. </p>
<p>The codes applies fully to minors. However, as minors are in a specific position, herewith are some guidelines on press dealings with minors.</p>
<p>The journalist must have the minors' best interests at heart. He is aware of both the minors' right to protection and the right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Whenever he lets a minor speak or be seen, or whenever a minor is spoken of by third parties, he considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the context, nature and sensitivity of the subject;</li>
<li>the emotional involvement of the minor with the subject; </li>
<li>the maturity and ability of the minor to form his own judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In exceptional situations minors consciously choose to play a public role. That lowers the threshold to report on them recognizably or to portray them in a recognizable way.</p>
<p><strong>When minors speak out</strong></p>
<p>The journalist who lets a minor speak, informs him about the purpose of the report in a way and at a level he can understand.</p>
<p>Whenever a minor speaks recognizably, the journalist should, in principle, ask the parents or guardian, or a third party who is entrusted with care and responsibility for the minor occasionally and temporarily, for permission.
• Permission is necessary for emotional or controversial subjects and for long-running series or reports in which the minor carries the story-line. The more emotional or controversial the subject matter, the more advisable it is to contact the parents or guardian directly.
• In exceptional cases a case may be made for not contacting the parents, for instance if the interests' of the parent/guardian and the minor conflict.
• Permission is not necessary for everyday or non-controversial subjects.</p>
<p>The journalist always considers the possibility of letting the minor speak anonymously or of using an alias.</p>
<p><strong>Depicting the minor</strong></p>
<p>The journalist who depicts a minor recognizably is bound in principle to ask the permission of the minor himself, and the parents, guardian or a third party who is entrusted with care and responsibility for the minor occasionally and temporarily.Permission is not necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>General images in public places;</li>
<li>Everyday, non-controversial subjects;</li>
<li>Depictions distributed by official bodies;</li>
<li>When there is a considerable public interest that overrides the interests of the minor.</li>
</ul>
<p>For events that are accessible to the press, or where the press is invited, the implicit permission of those present is assumed. When a minor or whoever is responsible for him at that time voices objections to recognizable images, the journalist takes this into account.</p>
<p>The journalist always considers whether or not it is advisable to make the minor unrecognizable. If he makes the images unrecognizable, he does so efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Archive material</strong></p>
<p>Whenever the journalist republishes an interview with, or images of, a minor, he takes into consideration the fact that minors and their surroundings evolve quickly.</p>
<p>It may be advisable not to republish older material or to ask for permission for re-publication again. See also the guideline for article 22 on digital archives and the reuse of archive material.</p>
<p><strong>Judicial context</strong></p>
<p>See the guideline for article 23 on the identification of minors in a judicial context.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 17. HIDDEN RECORDINGS, INCOGNITO AND ALIAS JOURNALISM</h3>
<p><em>Art. 17. In acquiring information, a journalist must make the purpose of his work known. He informs his interlocutor so that the interlocutor has enough information to decide whether or not he wishes to cooperate with the publication or broadcast.</em> *</p>
<p>There may be a reason why the journalist does not want to make himself known, or the purpose of his presence. That may be done in various ways, on certain conditions.</p>
<p>Incognito-journalism, where a journalist disguises his identity and concealed recordings are only permitted if the journalist could not have gathered the information, including sound- and visual recordings, in any other way and there is a public interest.</p>
<p>For alias-journalism, where the journalist takes on another identity deliberately, there needs to be a considerable public interest and consultation with the chief editor is advised. There should always be careful consideration whether there are not excessive risks taken for the safety of the journalist and of third parties. A journalist may not be pressured into accepting risky missions.</p>
<p>Broadcasting or online publishing of hidden recordings are only permissible if there is a public interest at stake and if the information, including sound and images, cannot be gathered in any other way. Consultation with the editor-in-chief is advised.</p>
<p>The journalist represents the content and circumstances of the recordings correctly. In principle, he ensures that those involved are not identifiable. If those involved are public figures, identification may be justified. If the journalist makes the images unrecognizable, he does so efficiently.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 20. HEARING</h3>
<p><em>Art. 20. The journalist offers the other party the option of a fair hearing when his reporting makes serious accusations that may damage the honour and reputation of that party.</em></p>
<p>When the journalist himself goes public with such accusations, he contacts the person involved before the publication or broadcast and offers the opportunity to react.</p>
<p>This is also advisable when he interviews someone who makes strong accusations or allegations. If in such cases there are good reasons not to allow for a reaction, or if it is not possible in practise, he contacts the person concerned afterwards. </p>
<p>The journalist gives the person concerned a reasonable space of time to react.</p>
<p>A hearing does not free the journalist from his task to report the facts as correctly as possible and to be critical as to his sources.</p>
<p>A reference to an official document issued by the police or the judicial system (such as courts of law, a disciplinary commission or a dope tribunal) is not an accusation as it is intended in this guideline.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 21. EMBARGO AND REQUEST TO DELAY THE REPORT</h3>
<p><em>Art. 21. The journalist may not make any arrangements with sources or other persons that jeopardize his independence. However, arrangements made must be kept, particularly regarding the naming of names or the prior inspection of texts. It is exactly for this reason that agreements must be clear and unambiguous.</em></p>
<p>Reporting can be the subject of an embargo. In this case a source disclosed information itself, but asks in return a deal on the moment of publication. When a journalist agrees to such an embargo, he adheres to it. An embargo is no longer binding when the information is known through another source.</p>
<p>Reporting may also be the subject of a request to delay. In this case the concerned party requests that the journalist does not disclose information which he has gathered himself. There may be exceptional reasons to agree to this request:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the news is still due to happen or if a delay is necessary for the news to have its full impact;</li>
<li>When the lives or health of people are at risk, or in order not to jeopardize the resolution of serious crimes against people, or to avoid any other serious adverse effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embargoes and requests for delay need only be honoured if they are correctly agreed, accurately and precisely described, convincingly and expressly motived, and apply to all media for a limited time.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 21. ON THE RECORD AND OFF THE RECORD INFORMATION</h3>
<p><em>Art. 21. The journalist may not make any arrangements with sources or other persons that jeopardize his independence. However, arrangements made must be kept, particularly regarding the naming of names or the prior inspection of texts. It is exactly for this reason that agreements must be clear and unambiguous.</em></p>
<p>If the journalist reaches an agreement with a source on the way in which he may cite the source, it is useful to use the terms ‘on the record' and ‘off the record', so that it is as clear as possible what is being agreed upon.</p>
<p>Information ‘on the record' means the journalist and the source agree that the source may be cited formally.</p>
<p>Information ‘off the record' means the journalist may use the information and the source may not be cited.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 22. THE USE OF INFORMATION AND IMAGES TAKEN FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND PERSONAL WEBSITES</h3>
<p><em>Art. 22. The journalist must take into account the rights of any and all persons mentioned in the reporting. He must weigh those rights up against the public interest in the information.</em></p>
<p>When the person involved has limited access to information or images on social media or a personal website, then this information may not be used in principle. The journalist must demonstrate a considerable public interest to justify its use. If there is no such overriding public interest, then he asks the person involved for permission.</p>
<p>Even on publicly accessible pages, personal information or messages may not be simply used in journalistic reporting, as there is a difference in context, extent and impact. The journalist there takes a number of considerations into account before he uses this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The journalist upholds the principles of respect for people's private lives.</li>
<li>The journalist only uses personal information or recognizable images if it is justified by the public interest in reporting it. If not, he asks the person concerned for permission.</li>
<li>This applies in particular to people in vulnerable situations, such as minors, victims of crime, of disasters or accidents, and those closest to them. If it transpires that victims or those closest to them object to using or publishing this material, the journalist should respect that.</li>
<li>The journalist takes into account that publishing information or images in a different context may hurt or offend people.</li>
<li>This discretion does not apply to the use of personal messages of public persons on publicly accessible platforms or media.</li>
</ul>
<p>The journalist checks the provenance and the veracity of the information or the images he uses.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 22. DIGITAL ARCHIVES AND RE-USE OF ARCHIVE MATERIAL</h3>
<p><em>Art. 22. The journalist must take into account the rights of any and all persons mentioned in the reporting. He must weigh those rights up against the public interest in the information.</em></p>
<p>The value and the public interest in archives that are as complete as possible and that faithfully reproduce what was published, and the right to information outweigh in principle the interests of persons seeking to remove, anonymise, block access to or amend archived articles, images, sound recordings or broadcasts.</p>
<p>When considering requests, the editorial staff must therefore weigh up the archive's importance to the public and the public's right to information, against the right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>The journalist must make this same assessment when he reuses information and images or sound recordings from archives at a later date. He takes the original context of the information and the images or sound recordings into consideration.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 22. HYPERLINKS</h3>
<p><em>Art. 22. The journalist must take into account the rights of any and all persons mentioned in the reporting. He must weigh those rights up against the public interest in the information.</em></p>
<p>When a journalist places a hyperlink, he gives the necessary context and weighs up the importance against the interests that may be affected by the placing of a hyperlink.</p>
<p>When a journalist embeds the context of another website into his own reporting, he is responsible for the whole.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 23. RESPECT FOR THE PRIVATE LIFE OF PUBLIC FIGURES</h3>
<p><em>Art. 23. The journalist must respect the right to privacy and must not probe further than public interest requires.</em></p>
<p>The journalist must be prudent when dealing with persons in a vulnerable situation, such as minors, victims of crime, disasters and accidents and those closest to them.</p>
<p>Respect for the private life applies to public figures too. Public figures are people who, in the circles relevant to the report, have a public or civic responsible function or role to play, or who enjoy wider media notoriety.</p>
<p>There are elements in the private life that may influence public functioning. Reporting on this may be in the public interest.</p>
<p>When known people offer a glimpse into their private lives or who seek media attention for their private lives, unsolicited reporting on their private lives may be justified as long as it is in proportion to the way those concerned go public with their private lives.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 23. IMAGES TAKEN IN PUBLIC PLACES OR AREAS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PRESS</h3>
<p><em>Art. 23. The journalist must respect the right to privacy and must not probe further than public interest requires.</em></p>
<p>The journalist must be prudent when dealing with persons in a vulnerable situation, such as minors, victims of crime, disasters and accidents and those closest to them. </p>
<p>At public events or events that are accessible for the press, the journalist has the implicit consent of all those present to take pictures, film or recordings and to publish or broadcast this report.</p>
<p>For the publication or emission of general images of people in public places, the journalist takes the nature of the subject and involvement of the depicted persons into account. The more controversial the subject and the less the person is involved in the subject, the less the use of the images is appropriate.</p>
<p>For the publication or broadcasting of images that are specifically of one or a few persons in public places the journalist asks for the permission of those concerned as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>When the concerned person(s) expresses the wish not to be portrayed, the journalist respects the question*. If necessary, he removes the material from the archive.</p>
<p>Incidents of acts which it is in the public interest to report on, with recognizable images, are not affected by abovementioned principles.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 23. IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS</h3>
<p><em>Art. 23. The journalist must respect the right to privacy and must not probe further than public interest requires.</em></p>
<p>The journalist must be prudent when dealing with persons in a vulnerable situation, such as minors, victims of crime, disasters and accidents and those closest to them.</p>
<p>The journalist is particularly reticent in making details known or publishing images that enable the identification of victims of crime, disasters and accidents and those closest to them. He weights up the public interest in the information against the rights of those concerned. The identification of public figures can be considered an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>If possible, the journalist makes the identity and the recognizable images of victims known after those closest to them may be assumed to have been informed.*</p>
<p>If the journalist portrays the victims, he considers the public interest and informative value of the images versus the rights of the victims and those closest to them. If he decides to make the victims hard to recognise, he does so efficiently.</p>
<p>The journalist takes the request of a victim, or those closest to him, not to be identified seriously.</p>
<p>Every identification of victims of sexual violence is forbidden by law unless they explicitly give written consent or the investigating magistrate gives consent.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR 23. IDENTIFICATION IN JURIDICAL CONTEXT</h3>
<p><em>Art. 23. The journalist must respect the right to privacy and must not probe further than public interest requires.</em></p>
<p>The journalist must be prudent when dealing with persons in a vulnerable situation, such as minors, victims of crime, disasters and accidents and those closest to them.</p>
<p><strong>In general</strong></p>
<p>The journalist takes the uncertainty of the juridical process into account, including the possible innocence of the suspect. He ensures this is clear in his reporting.</p>
<p>When the suspect on whom the journalist previously published a recognizable report is released or exonerated, the journalist mentions this loyally.</p>
<p>The journalist weighs up the public interest in the reporting against the chances of reclassification and reintegration.</p>
<p>If the journalist refers to the case in the future, or to the legal file, he takes earlier juridical decisions or verdicts into account.</p>
<p><strong>Identification of suspects and the condemned</strong></p>
<p>When the journalist in his reporting identifies a suspect or a condemned person, he weighs up the public's right to information against the person's right to privacy. Depending on the situation he chooses not to identify, to limit identification or to disclose identity fully.</p>
<p><em>Limited identification</em></p>
<p>The name, the initial of the surname, the age and the place where the suspect or convicted person lives, may be mentioned, on following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited identification is possible and the degree to which this is applied depends on the severity of the facts, the state of the investigation or the procedure and the public interest in reporting on the facts. For minor offences limited identification is not automatically available.</li>
<li>If the journalist mentions the identifying elements, he is extra careful with other facts, including images and sound reports, that make identification possible.</li>
<li>If the journalist makes images and sound recordings unrecognizable, he does so efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Full identification</em></p>
<p>Full identification of suspects and condemned persons is permissible under one of the following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>A public interest. In the case of a suspect, the public interest needs to be considerable. </li>
<li>The suspect or condemned person is a public figure and public interest justifies complete identification.</li>
<li>The suspect or condemned person discloses information about himself and does not object to identification.</li>
<li>For serious offences only in the case of a suspect when the guilt is to be expected, for instance due to a confession, being caught red handed or due to information from a reliable source.</li>
<li>The suspect is on the run and the police or judiciary have issued a search warrant with full identification and/or recognizable images.</li>
<li>The full identification of the suspect may be a warning for potential new victims.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identification of victims</strong></p>
<p>See the guideline for article 23 on the identification of victims.</p>
<p><strong>Identification of minors</strong></p>
<p><em>The juvenile court</em></p>
<p>Every identification of a minor who has had measures imposed by a juvenile court, is legally forbidden and therefore punishable. It makes no difference whether it is about a youngster who has committed offences described as crimes or a youngster in a worrying environment</p>
<p>From a professional ethical point of view, identification may be justified in a number of cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the reporting is not at all about the case and the measure imposed by the juvenile court is not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To publish identification details which the justice department, police or Child Focus have released themselves, for instance as part of a search effort. If these instances in a later phase, ask for the dissemination of the facts to be stopped, then the journalist respects that as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In exceptional cases of great public interest, for instance to allow a minor to make his or her case clear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The crucial question is whether the identification is in the interest of the minor himself. </p>
<p><em>Judicial context outside the juvenile court</em></p>
<p>Underage victims, witnesses and other persons involved in a juridical context should, in principle, not be identified.</p>
<p>When the juvenile judge hands the minor over to a regular court, the abovementioned principles regarding the suspects and condemned apply.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 24. REPORTING ON SUICIDE</h3>
<p><em>Art. 24. The journalist must respect human dignity and must not probe further than public interest requires.</em></p>
<p>The journalist must practice restraint in the selection of details and/or images for publication, even when the facts concerned strongly affect public opinion.</p>
<p>In reporting on suicide the journalist respects the privacy of the person concerned and those closest to him. He avoids simplification of the immediate cause(s) leading up to the attempt, dramatizing the situation, detailed descriptions and a positive emphasis on the facts.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE FOR ARTICLE 26. REPORTING ON FUNERALS AND MOURNING CEREMONIES</h3>
<p><em>Art. 26. The journalist should respect the suffering of victims and of their relatives. He must not behave inappropriately in his acquisition of the facts.</em></p>
<p>The journalist reports on mourning ceremonies with respect and takes the wishes of those involved into consideration.</p>

<p><em>Adopted by the Council of Journalistic Ethics (CDJ) on 16th October 2013</em></p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>The right to information, freedom of expression and criticism are fundamental rights and essential prerequisites for a democratic society.</p>
<p>Journalists have the right and duty to inform the public about matters of public interest. This should not to be confused with the curiosity of the public, which does not have an absolute right to know everything. Journalists do not have an absolute right to disclose everything.</p>
<p>The public's right to know these matters determines both journalistic freedom and responsibility. Journalists are bound by standards that derive from the obligations of:</p>
<ul>
<li>disseminating verified information;</li>
<li>collecting and disseminating information independently;</li>
<li>acting with loyalty;</li>
<li>respecting the rights of persons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other person who disseminates information is encouraged to adhere to these standards.</p>
<p>Journalists' responsibility towards the public takes precedence over their responsibilities to special interests, public authorities and their employers.</p>
<p>Journalists have a social responsibility inherent in press freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>
Some of the standards contained in this Code are supplemented, clarified or developed by guidelines presented in Part III of the document and available on the CDJ website. They are indicated by an arrow (=&gt;).</p>
<p>Journalists may exceptionally bypass certain rules of this Code when the information is of overriding public interest and cannot be collected or reported in any other way. The rules to which exceptions may be made subject to any additional conditions are marked with an *.</p>
<p>Amendments to the Code after 2013 appear in italics with the date of approval by the CDJ in square
brackets.</p>

The quoting of brands, companies, personalities, events, institutions, etc. shall meet journalistic criteria only. Journalists report on events sponsored by their media with the same ethics as they would on any other event. =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 14 Journalists shall not act as auxiliaries to the police or other security services. They shall only be obliged to pass on to them information that has already been made public in their media. =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 15 Journalists shall not use in their own interests or in the interests of their relatives the financial information of which they are aware before it is made available to the public. They shall refrain from any form of insider trading and market manipulation. =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 16 The decision on whether or not to publish, in whole or in part, reactions from the public, as well as the management and moderation, preferably a priori, of online forums and dialogue spaces, shall be the sole independent responsibility of the editorial staff. The editorial staff shall respect the meaning and spirit of the comments reported. =&gt;</p>
<h2>III. Act with Loyalty</h2>
<p>Art. 17 Journalists shall use fair methods to collect and process information, photos, images and documents. =&gt;</p>
<p>In particular, the following are considered unfair methods: committing criminal offences, concealing one's status as a journalist, deceiving the purpose of one's intervention, using a false identity, clandestine registration, paying sources of information ... [16/12/2015] [^1]</p>
<p>These methods shall not be considered unfair when all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information sought is of general interest and importance to society;</li>
<li>the information cannot be obtained by other means;</li>
<li>the risks incurred by journalists and third parties remain proportionate to the result sought;</li>
<li>the methods used are authorised or, where appropriate, validated by the editor-in-chief, except in the case of unforeseeable exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Art. 18 The editorial offices are free to remunerate the authors of exclusive texts, sounds and images, provided that other media are not deprived of access to the same sources of information. =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 19 Journalists shall not engage in plagiarism. When they pass on exclusive information previously published by another medium, they shall mention the source.</p>
<p>Art. 20 Journalists shall demonstrate mutual understanding and loyalty among themselves, without renouncing their freedom of investigation, information, comment, criticism, satire and editorial choices, as set forth in Article 9.</p>
<p>Art. 21 Journalists shall keep secret the identity of informers to whom they have promised confidentiality. The same shall apply when journalists may presume that the information was given to them under the condition of anonymity or when they may fear endangering such informants. In such cases, journalists do not disclose anything that would make their source identifiable. * (see also article 1) =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 22 Where journalists broadcast serious accusations that could damage a person's reputation or honour, they shall give that person an opportunity to put forward his or her point of view before the accusations are broadcast. The impossibility of obtaining an answer does not prevent the dissemination of information, but the public must be warned of this impossibility.</p>
<p>Art. 23 Journalists shall not make any commitment to any interlocutor which might jeopardise their independence. However, they shall respect the methods of dissemination that they have freely accepted, such as embargoes, &quot;off&quot;, anonymity, etc. These commitments must be clear and indisputable. =&gt;</p>
<h2>IV. Respect the rights of persons</h2>
<p>Art. 24 Journalists shall take into account the rights of any person mentioned explicitly or implicitly in a piece of information. They shall weigh these rights against the general interest of the information. Image rights apply to images accessible online.</p>
<p>Art. 25 Journalists shall respect the privacy of individuals and shall not reveal any personal data that are not relevant to the general interest. =&gt;</p>
<p>Art. 26 Journalists shall avoid intrusion into the pain of persons and the dissemination of information and images offensive to human dignity except where relevant to the public interest.</p>
<p>Art. 27 Journalists shall pay particular attention to the rights of persons unfamiliar with the media and persons in fragile situations such as minors or victims of violence, accidents, attacks, etc., as well as their relatives.</p>
<p>Art. 28 Journalists shall mention personal characteristics only if they are relevant to the public interest. When reporting on these characteristics, journalists shall avoid stereotypes, generalisations, exaggerations and stigmatisation. They shall refrain from even indirect incitement to discrimination, racism and xenophobia. [25/5/2016] [^2] =&gt;</p>
<h3>Part II Definitions</h3>
<p><em>Image rights</em> Every natural person has a right to his or her image and to the use made of it, a right which no one may, in principle, enjoy without his or her prior consent. However, in the field of information, when a person is identifiable in an image, his consent may be presumed, in particular when his image has been captured in a public place or at a public event without unjustified emphasis, as well as when the person represented makes his image public himself or when he has given his tacit but certain consent to the taking of photographs.</p>
<p><em>General interest</em> From the point of view of journalistic ethics, information that raises one or more issues for society as a whole or for one of its components is of general interest. Some codes use the terms public interest or societal interest. These terms all mark the difference with special interest. In any case, general interest is not to be confused with mere curiosity on the part of the public.</p>
<p><em>Journalist</em> For the purposes of this Code, a journalist is any person who contributes directly to the collection, editorial processing, production and/or dissemination of information, through a media outlet, intended for the public and in the interest of the public.</p>
<p><em>Media</em> A natural or legal person whose activity is the production and/or dissemination of journalistic information, regardless of the medium used.</p>
<p><em>Plagiarism</em>
By plagiarism, this code refers to the textual or quasi-textual reproduction of an original work without quoting the author.</p>
<p><em>Editorial</em>
The term editorial staff refers to those responsible and all members of the group or department responsible for the collection and processing of journalistic content within a media outlet.</p>
<p>[^1]: On 16th December 2015, The Council – CDJ – decided to remove provocation, blackmail and harassment from the list in Article 17. These practices remain criminal offences considered as unfair methods, but they are difficult to objectivise, unlike the methods which remain explicitly designated as unfair above.
[^2]: On 25th May 2016, prior to the adoption of the recommendation on information relating to foreigners or persons of foreign origin and assimilated themes, the CDJ decided to add the words &quot;... to racism and xenophobia&quot; at the end of article 28 of the Code of Journalistic Ethics implementing it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In accordance with the Constitution of Bulgaria and its international human rights agreements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaffirming that everyone has the fundamental right to freedom of expression, access to information, protection of personal dignity and privacy, and the right to safety and security;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaffirming that the media should be guaranteed the freedom to operate without any form of censorship;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realising that to maintain these rights, the media have freedoms and responsibilities, as well as other rights and obligations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declaring that our primary purpose in abiding by the letter and the spirit of this Code is to honour the right of the public to receive and distribute reliable information so that they can play an active role as citizens in an open democracy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recognition of our responsibility to respect these rights, we, as representatives of the Bulgarian media, commit ourselves to the following principles:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. SUPPLYING THE PUBLIC WITH RELIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>1. Accuracy</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shall supply the public with accurate and verified information and we shall not deliberately suppress or distort facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not publish information we know to be inaccurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not mislead the public, and we will clearly indicate where manipulated texts, documents, images, and sounds have been used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture, and facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In presenting analysis and comment we shall seek to ensure that a diversity of opinions and views is represented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reporting on a controversy we shall seek to ensure that the parties concerned have an opportunity to state their position.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Corrections</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shall publish a clear and appropriately prominent correction when it can be demonstrated that inaccurate or misleading information has been published, and we shall provide an apology if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall provide a right of reply to individuals and organisations directly affected by inaccurate or misleading publications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Sources</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shall endeavour to verify information, as we look for and use different sources, before it is published, and we shall indicate its provenance where appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prefer to use identified sources rather than anonymous sources, as the latter's honesty and reliability cannot be assessed by the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall protect the identity of confidential sources of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall always indicate where information has not been confirmed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. COLLECTION AND PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>1. Identification</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shall gather information by fair and legal means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall only make use of subterfuge, hidden cameras, microphones, and other special equipment or means, including obscuring our professional identity, if there are no other means to obtain information deemed exceptionally important to the public interest; we shall indicate such methods in the respective story.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Harassment</h3>
<ol>
<li>We shall not use threats, force, or harassment to obtain information or images.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Privacy</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We respect the inviolability of everyone's private life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall avoid publishing photographs and recordings of individuals if these photographs and recordings were taken or made outside of the realm of a public space and without their consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not add to the distress of people affected by tragedy or crime and shall report such matters with sympathy and constraint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall respect the wish of people to grieve in private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only an exceptional circumstance that is important to the public interest would justify the media's intrusion into private and family life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, public figures can expect a lesser degree of privacy; however, information about their private lives can be disclosed only if it serves the public interest.</p>
<h3>4. Children</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall demonstrate special responsibility in respecting the rights of children, including their right to be heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not take advantage of a child's innocence and trust.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3>6. Crime and brutality</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We respect the assumption of innocence and will not describe a person as a criminal prior to the person's conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we identify a person as being charged with a crime, we shall also make known the outcome of the trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall treat with caution the identification of victims and witnesses of crime, especially in cases involving sexual assault, unless the respective victims and witnesses give consent to being identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall refrain from glorifying or unnecessarily sensationalising crime, violence, and brutality when reporting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall be careful not to be used as a platform for those who would promote, incite, or otherwise use violence; we shall report on such activities with due constraint and only if it clearly serves the public interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>7. Decency</h3>
<ol><li>1. We shall respect good taste and decency in our publications.</li></ol>
<h3>8. Suicides</h3>
<ol><li>1. We shall avoid publishing details of suicide methods in order to limit the risk of imitation.</ol></li>
<h2>3. EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We shall not be susceptible to political or commercial pressure or influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall maintain a clear distinction between editorial decision making, and the commercial policy of the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall maintain a clear distinction between editorial content, and marketing, advertisements, or sponsored materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not accept any personal, political, or financial inducements that may impact our ability to provide the public with accurate information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not use our access to information as a means of obtaining personal gain, especially in respect to information regarding business performance and financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall avoid covering stories where we have a direct personal interest, or, if we pursue such stories, we should at least declare our personal interests where relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We respect the right of individual journalists to refuse, or refuse being identified as the author of, assignments or publications which would break the letter and spirit of this Code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall not pay sources for information, but where payment is considered necessary in order to obtain information that clearly serves the public interest, we shall make known that payments have been made for such information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>4. RELATIONS BETWEEN AND WITHIN MEDIA</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We believe that relationships between different media outlets and between media professionals should be characterised by mutual respect and fair competition in order to preserve the integrity of the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that the public has a right to know who owns and controls media outlets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We consider all forms of plagiarism to be unacceptable in all circumstances.</p>
</li>

<p>We respect copyright and the terms of copyright agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall always acknowledge the source of short extracts of material from other media which may be in use without their express permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall only reproduce longer extracts or complete materials from other media with the prior permission and acknowledgement of the respective author and media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall support media colleagues when they are unfairly attacked or criticised. However, professional solidarity should not be an excuse for suppressing or distorting information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that individual journalists who respected the letter and spirit of this Code yet are charged in court by third parties should be supported by their respective media outlet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. PUBLIC INTEREST</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Infringement of the terms of this Code may only be justified where it can be clearly and fully demonstrated that the respective publication serves the best interests of the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this Code, information that is in, of, serves, or is otherwise important to 'the public interest' should not be confused with information that is 'interesting to the public.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A publication is in, of, serves, or is otherwise important to 'the public interest' only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it protects the health, safety and security of the public;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it helps the prevention and disclosure of serious crimes and abuse of power regarding the public; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it prevents the public from the danger of being seriously misled.</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>a) Whereas the free flow of information is one of the most important guarantees of liberty and democracy;</p>
<p>b) Whereas freedom of the press derives from the fundamental freedoms of thought, speech, free expression and opinion, and is widely legally recognized so nationally and internationally, and as such no one must dictate content to news media;</p>

<p>e) Whereas the notion of the public interest is variable to different cultures and eras and this pursuit of the public interest entails journalists' access to privileged information vital to responding to the political, economic, social, and cultural concerns of citizens to allow them informed participation in the life of a democracy;</p>
<p>f) Whereas journalists and news media are first and foremost servants of the public, and the public's right to information supersedes any other considerations regarding editorial choices;</p>
<p>g) Whereas journalists and news media ought in all situations to provide the public with reliable information;</p>
<p>h) Whereas the public's right to information is foundational to journalistic ethics;</p>
<p>i) Whereas, in order to ensure the full exercise of freedom of the press and the public's right to information, the Press Council has been specifically founded to hear public complaints concerning journalistic ethics;</p>
<p>j) Whereas, in order to hear and adjudicate such complaints, the ethical principles guiding journalism must be set down;</p>

<h2>Section C: Pursuing the truth</h2>
<h3>9. Qualitative characteristics of information</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of journalism, news and information pieces produced by journalists and news media should possess the following qualities:
a) accuracy: fidelity to the truth;
b) rigorous reasoning;
c) impartiality: providing an unbiased point of view;
d) balance: striving to present all sides of a story;
e) completeness: presenting all the facts and information essential to understanding while preserving editorial freedom.</p>
<h3>10. Types of journalism</h3>
<p>1) There are essentially two types of journalism, each with its own ethical requirements: objective reporting and opinion pieces.
2) The public must easily be able to identify which type so as not to be misled in any way.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Factual journalism</strong>
(1) Factual journalism reports facts and events and contextualizes them.
(2) Such information must be accurate, rigorous in its reasoning, impartial, balanced and complete, as defined in article 9 of this Guide.</p>

(1) In opinion pieces, journalists have great latitude with their choice of tone and style. They may express personal points of view, take sides, and provide criticism, comments and opinions.
(2) Opinion journalists ought to describe the relevant facts on which they base their opinions, unless these facts are already common knowledge. They also have a duty to share their reasoning.
(3) The information reported must be accurate and complete and rooted in rigorous reasoning, as defined in article 9 of this Guide.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

(b) the information cannot be obtained by any other reasonable means
(c) the source may suffer harm if revealed.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<h3>13. Agreements with a source</h3>
<p>1) Journalists must try to respect, by all means at their disposal, any agreement between themselves and a source to whom they have explicitly agreed (confidentiality, off the record, not for attribution, embargo, etc.), unless the source has knowingly deceived them.</p>
<p>2) Journalists may however publish information covered by a confidentiality agreement if they have obtained such information otherwise.</p>
<p>3) Journalists may reveal the identity of a source to a senior editor equally committed to respecting the confidentiality agreement. This is standard journalistic practice and is in no way equivalent to naming a source publicly.</p>

"11_CH";"Switzerland";"CH";"Declaration of Duties and Rights of Journalists";"<h1>Declaration</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The right to information, together with freedom of expression and criticism, is one of the fundamental liberties of every human being.The rights and duties of journalists de- volve from the public's right to have access to fact and opinion.</p>
<p>Journalists' responsibility to the public must come before any they bear towards a third party, notably employers and public authorities.</p>
<p>Journalists should, of their own accord, adopt the rules necessary to accomplish their mission to inform. Such is the object of the «Declaration of Duties» below.</p>
<p>In order to carry out their journalistic du- ties in an independent manner, and in ac- cordance with required quality standards, journalists must be able to count on general conditions adequate to the exercise of their profession. Such is the object of the «Declaration of Rights» that follows.</p>
<p>Journalists see their duty in following the basic principles of this declaration. While recognising the laws of their country, journalists only accept the judgment of their professional colleagues, the Press Council or legitimate organizations of professional ethics. They reject any interference by the state or other official bodies. Fair reporting requires at least a short, published summary of a Press Council decision in relation to one's own media.</p>
<h2>Declaration of Duties of a Journalist</h2>
<p>The journalist who gathers, selects, edits, interprets and comments on information is ruled by general principles of fairness in his or her honest treatment of sources (the people with whom he or she is talking) and the public. The journalist's duties are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To seek out the truth, in the interests of the public's right to know, whatever the consequences to him- or herself.</li>
<li>To defend freedom of information, freedom of commentary and criticism, and the independence and dignity of the journalistic profession.</li>
<li>Not to publish information, documents, images or sound recordings of which the origin is unknown to the journalist. Not to suppress information or any essential elements of a story. Not to misrepresent any text, document, image or sound recording, nor people's expressed opinions. If information is unconfirmed to clearly say so. To indicate when photographic and/or sound material has been combined to make a montage.</li>
<li>Not to use dishonest methods to obtain information, recordings, images or documents. Not to manipulate them, or have them manipulated by a third party with a view to falsification. To prohibit plagiarism in not passing off the work or ideas of others as one's own.</li>
<li>To rectify any published information that is revealed to be factually incorrect.</li>
<li>To respect professional secrecy and not reveal the source of any information obtained in confidence.</li>
<li>To respect peoples' privacy in so far as the public interest does not demand otherwise. To disregard anonymous or unfounded accusations.</li>
<li>In respecting human dignity, the journalist must avoid any allusion by text, image or sound to a person's ethnic or national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation as well as to any illness or physical or mental handicap that could be discriminatory in character. The reporting of war, acts of terrorism, accidents and catastrophes by means of text, image and sound should respect the victims' suffering and the feelings of their loved ones.</li>
<li>Not to accept any advantage nor any promise that could limit his or her profes- sional independence or expression of opinion.</li>
<li>To avoid as journalists any form of commercial advertising; and never to accept conditions laid down by advertisers directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>To take journalistic directives only from designated editorial superiors; and to respect those directives only when they are not contrary to this declaration.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Declaration of Rights of a Journalist</h2>
<p>Full respect by journalists of the duties articulated above requires that they enjoy, at the minimum, the following rights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free access to all sources of information and the right to investigate without impediment anything that is in the public interest. Public or private confidentiality can only be invoked against the journalist in exceptional circumstances and with the provision of clearly-defined reasons.</li>
<li>The right not to act in any way nor express any opinion that is contrary to professional rules or personal conscience. As a result, journalists should not suffer any prejudice.</li>
<li>The right to refuse any directive or interference that is contrary to the general policy of the organisation with which he or she is collaborating. This policy must be communicated in writing before the journalist's employment. It cannot be modified or revoked unilaterally under pain of breach of contract.</li>
<li>The right to transparency as to the ownership of the company for which the journalist works. The right of a member of an editorial team to be informed in time, and to be heard before, any decision that affects the future of the company. In particular, members of the editorial staff must be informed and heard before final decisions determining the com- position or organisation of the editorial department.</li>
<li>The right to adequate and continuous professional training.</li>
<li>The right to benefit from work conditions guaranteed by a collective agreement, including the right to be active in professional organisations without suffering discrimination.</li>
<li>The right to benefit from an individual employment contract guaranteeing material and moral security. In particular, an appropriate remuneration – corresponding to the journalist's function, responsibilities and social role – should ensure his or her economic independence.</li>

This Code applies to all media (print and electronic, semi-state or private) and all those working for them.

The Media and those working for them undertake the obligation to cooperate with the Commission in carrying out its investigations. Their non-cooperation constitutes a breach of the Code.

Respect for the truth and the citizen's right to objective, full and reliable information in an obligation of all media and journalists.

Respect for the journalist's right to unobstructed access to the sources of news and transparency are necessary prerequisites for proper information.

The conduct, dignity, honesty and professional standard of journalists should be of the highest standard. Journalists refrain from publishing stories or from the use of a language which, by prevailing standards, are considered vulgar or obscene.

The Commission has a duty to defend the Right of Expression and more specifically, the freedom of expression of journalists of print and electronic Mass Media.

The Commission, on its own initiative, or after the lodging of a complaint may deal with allegations that material either published or broadcast, or any act or omission by anyone constitutes a violation or a threat against the aforementioned liberties. In the case it decides to take up the complaint, the Commission gives the opportunity to the parties involved to present their views and positions, either in writing or verbally. It the case of the Commission ascertains that there is a case of violation of threat as above, it makes its findings public unless it decides otherwise.

The Commission has a duty to defend the independence of journalists.

Journalists have an obligation to defend their independence and not to allow interference with their work. Interference in the work of journalists and intimidation or attempted intimidation or influencing journalists with statements or otherwise is impermissible.

Journalists in carrying out their function:

 1. Respect and promote democracy and other universal values. They respect and promote human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all.

 2. Show the indicated sensitivity in matters that concern national security and are particularly careful in presenting issues such as violence, crime, sexual offences, human grief and death, as well as information or pictures that are hurtful or could cause panic, horror, or revulsion, especially to children.

### 2. Right of Reply

The Media give a fair opportunity of reply, in the appropriate case, to those affected and particularly when they have been attacked. This opportunity will be given not so long after the time of publication, that the right of reply shall have no meaning.

### 3. Private Life

The reputation and private life of every individual is respected. Intrusions and investigations into the private life of individuals without their consent, including the taking of pictures of people without their knowledge or consent, unless they are involved in events which constitute news of general interest, or on private property and also the gathering of information through bugging devices or long lens photography, are generally unacceptable and their publication can only be justified in exceptional cases an solely in the public interest.

In cases involving mourning, grief or shock, an approach characterised by discretion and sympathy to the utmost degree is necessary, as well as avoidance of any act that may increase human pain.

The media should refrain from publishing/broadcasting pictures of people in conditions of mourning, grief or shock and in those cases that publication or broadcasting of such pictures is justified, they should deal with such cases with special care.

No news about suicides is published. In those extraordinary cases that circumstances justify publication, sensitivity and special care should be shown so as to avoid details about the method, even if those details were obtained through a qualified procedure. This clause does not prevent the publication of information obtained from judicial proceedings, provided that all other relevant clauses of the Code of Practice are taken into account. 


### 6. OBTAINING OF INFORMATION

Functionaries of the Media should not, as a general rule, try to secure information or images/photographs through false representation or any other fraudulent manner.

With the exception of serving public interest, documents and images/photographs can only be taken with the consent of their owner.

Functionaries do not obtain or try to obtain information or images/photographs through intimidation or blackmail.

The Media should not publish-broadcast pictures which had been mechanically or electronically modified without informing the public. When doing so they should explain the reasons for such modification. This obligation does not exist when the modification is manifest and the reason is obvious, e.g. for reasons of satire.

### 9. Presumption of Innocence

Functionaries of the Media fully respect the principle that a person suspected or accused of having committed a crime is innocent until the contrary is proven in accordance with the law, and consequently avoid publishing anything which may lead to conclusions regarding either the guilt or innocence of suspects or accused or tends to smear their reputation or publicly humiliate them.


### 10. Sexual Crimes

### 14. Journalistic Confidentiality

Functionaries of the Media have a moral obligation to observe professional privilege regarding the source of information obtained confidentially. A journalist is not obliged to reveal the source of his information. At the same time, it is the duty of a journalist to make sure that his sources and their information are reliable.


### 15. Public Interest

Under this Code, cases which justify deviation from the rule, by invoking public interest, are mainly the following: n(a) Helping to detect or expose crime. (b) Protecting public safety and health. (c) Protecting human rights. (d) Preventing deception of the public as a result of acts or statements by individuals or organizations.

## ADDENDUM


### EXPLANATORY GUIDELINES


On the basis of the relevant provision of the Journalists' Code of Practice, the Ethics Committee has issued the following explanatory guidelines, cited here in chronological order of addition to the Code: 


**1. Publicizing the Names of Traffic or Other Accident Victims** 

The Ethics Committee feels obliged to bring to the attention of Press and Electronic Media professionals that, on a number of occasions, the relatives of victims of fatal accidents, either traffic or other accidents and incidents, are put through needless suffering when learning of their loved ones' death or injury on the radio or TV.

The Committee calls upon Media professionals to exercise great caution and responsibility applying the highest professional standards in situations like these, and exercise caution in reporting serious traffic or other accidents without identifying the victims.


**2. Bringing Suspects to Courts - Presumption of Innocence** 

The Ethics Committee cautions Press and Electronic Media professionals on the coverage of cases where people either suspected or accused of having committed a crime are brought to court, and recommends the following:


 1. Media reporting on such cases must not be in violation of the presumption of innocence and must not contribute to the derision or pillorying of citizens. 

 2. When pursuing court and police reporting, exaggeration and overpublicizing cases of lesser importance should be avoided. 

 3. The use of photographs in cases of suspects not yet officially charged must be made with the greatest possible caution and restraint, and only when deemed professionally necessary.

 4. The Mass Media and media professionals ought to fully respect the presumption of innocence of people arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime. Based on the legal principle that suspects are presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court, the Mass Media and media professionals should neither directly nor indirectly assign guilt to the suspect and should avoid any guilt-assigning phrases and characterizations.


At the same time, the Committee feels obliged to bring to the attention of the Minister of Justice and Public Order, and also the Police, that the practice of transferring either suspects or the accused to court in handcuffs (barring exceptional cases or if essential reasons apply) has been abandoned long ago by most countries. 

The Committee believes it is high time the competent authorities took this development into serious consideration as this particular practice does not comply with respect of human dignity in a contemporary society. 


**3. Publicizing the Names of Rape Victims**

The Ethics Committee finds that significant progress has been achieved regarding the manner in which the Cypriot Mass Media treat victims of rape or other sexual crimes.

At the same time, it notes that there have been cases where even though the victim's identity was not revealed, the publication of information and details relevant to the case either reproduced the sexual abuse or tended to create the impression of the victim's shared responsibility or justify the perpetrator's behaviour. This kind of media conduct is both unacceptable and condemnable.

The principle of non-disclosure of the identity of victims or other details that may reveal their identity applies generally when Cypriot citizens are involved, a fact noted with satisfaction.

It is also noted, however, that this praiseworthy attitude of the Mass Media does not apply in cases where the victims of sexual crimes are non-Cypriots.

There is obviously a false impression among media professionals that since the victims are foreigners and are not known in Cyprus, publicizing their names is not a reprehensible act. 

The Ethics Committee feels obliged to underline that the Mass Media ought to deal with incidents of this kind without discriminations and with the same sensibility and respect they demonstrate when Cypriots are involved.


**4. Mass Media handling of drug cases** 

The Mass Media undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping public opinion both generally and specifically regarding the use of addictive substances. 

The manner in which this particular topic is represented in news reports, footage or articles, or the use of standardized phrases, the publication of photographic material that may cause fear or insecurity or not provide an accurate description of the problem, may have negative consequences and cause the opposite results than those pursued in the context of a policy of prevention.

Proper information and training of journalists on the topic of addictions can contribute to the promotion of the basic principles of prevention policy.

The Mass Media address a diversified pubic that includes groups who may have varied needs regarding prevention. Therefore, the messages conveyed have a different effect on different individuals. 

For that reason, there cannot be one single recipe for presenting information through the Mass Media. There is, though, a set of basic principles that need to be taken into account. 


*Basic Principles*

The process of developing and manufacturing drug substances must not be described, as this may be construed as encouragement for the use or instructions for using drugs by individuals prone to the use of substances, or others wishing to experiment. Similarly, there cannot be any reference in a direct or indirect way, to easy or great profit that may be yielded by trading drugs.

Methods of taking addictive substances or instruments of manufacturing or using drug substances can neither be described nor presented.

Not all substances are collectively referred to as WHITE DEATH because not all substances are white and not all lead to death.

Portraying individuals arrested for producing or using drugs as heroes or idols must be avoided.

The use of argot or terms employed by individuals who either trade drugs or are addicted to using them must be avoided.


**5. Practice of financial journalism** 

Explanatory guidelines regarding the practice of financial journalism with special reference to investment recommendations based on European Union Directives.


*General principles*

 - Directives 2003/6/EC and 2003/125/EC;

 - The specific provisions of the Code on the accuracy of information, on non-deriving financial gain through the use of information in the possession of journalists, and on the right of non-disclosure;
 - The basic general rule that journalists have the obligation to comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code:

1. The entanglement of journalists in conflicts of interests is both unacceptable and condemnable.

2. Journalists work to ensure prevention of market manipulation in every possible way.

3. Journalists declare any interests or conflicts of interests.


*Analytically*

1.2. Journalists neither publish nor broadcast news regarding investment recommendations if they or their next-of-kin anticipate profit from the selling, holding or otherwise of shares about which they are in possession of information.

1.3.

Indicative examples of such acts are the publication of false or ungrounded information that either gives or may give false or misleading signals as to the supply of, demand for or price of financial instruments, artificial or abnormal interference with the market, the path and/or volume of transactions of financial instruments and participation or encouragement of participation in acts aimed at market manipulation. 

3. Journalists declare any interests or conflicts of interests.

3.1. In line with the provisions of the Journalists' Code of Ethics, journalists must, where possible, cite the sources of their information.

3.2. When publishing investment recommendations, they ought to declare interests or conflicts of interests concerning themselves or persons with whom they have close ties. When this is considered inapplicable, they must specify the source from which the public may seek information for the existence of interests or conflicts of interests.

3.3. When publishing investment recommendations of third parties or other information of a financial nature originating from third parties, or the summary of investment recommendations of third parties, they ought to declare interests or conflicts of interests of the third parties.

### FINAL PROVISION

The Committee, by issuing these GUIDING PRINCIPLES shall take into account, in an indicative way, the interpretation of the First Annex to the Law on Insider Dealing and Manipulation (Market Abuse) of 2005, as regards the meaning of the terms referred to therein.

Close ties:

A person who has close ties with another person is:

- The spouse and relatives within up to the second degree of consanguinity; 
- A person who, in the Committee's view, is in a co-dependent relation or a relation that is premised to a substantial degree on common interests;
- Persons acting in concert, namely persons who cooperate between them in concerted practice or in the context of an agreement;
- Other relatives or persons living under the same roof for at least one year on the date of the transaction;
- Any enterprise controlled by a natural person or jointly with the spouse or with relatives within up to the second degree of consanguinity, where they own a percentage of at least 20% of the share capital or of the voting rights at a general assembly. 


**COMMENTS**

The Ethics Committee, considering that the issue of financial journalism is of crucial importance, intends to denounce publicly and without delay any cases where violation of the aforementioned guidelines has been noted.

The Journalists' Code of Practice and the guidelines issued based on the Code apply both in letter and in spirit. Their intention is clear: No journalist or manager/editor-in-chief should take on any form of activity related to the exercise of financial journalism which leaves room for misinterpretation or may lead to calling into question the integrity of himself/herself or of the Media employing him/her.

No loophole should be sought to justify any action or act that does not comply with the letter and the spirit of the Code and the Guiding Principles.

The Code and Guiding Principles apply for all Mass Media, journalists and managers/editors-in-chief. It imposes upon journalists the obligation to disclose to their managers/editors-in-chief whether they own shares that are newsworthy. 

The well-intentioned exercise of journalism requires managers/editors-in-chief to disclose their own interests in shares, as described above, to the Media Publisher/Director. Keeping an Internal Register is a practical manner in which this obligation may be fulfilled. 

The basic criterion must be applying common sense. Therefore, the ultimate objective is to protect journalists and journalism from being exposed to accusations for dishonest or self-seeking practices.


**6. Media coverage of suicide cases**

In summary:

News on suicides must not be published or broadcast uncritically, barring exceptional cases where the story is highly newsworthy due to special circumstances. 

Where publication is justified, the use of sensational language and expressions or the normalization of suicide or its presentation as a way out of problems must be avoided.

The explicit description of the method or process of a suicide or attempted suicide must be avoided.

Detailed information on the site of a completed or attempted suicide is not to be cited.

Headlines must be worded very carefully. 

The use of photographs or video footage must be done with caution.

Particular care must be put on reporting celebrity suicides.

People bereaved by suicide must be treated with due consideration.

A suicide could provide an opportunity to inform the public about the phenomenon of suicide through supplying information on its repercussions on relatives and friends and on where a person may turn for help.

As a general principle, Mass Media do not publish news on suicides, with the exception of rare cases where publication is justified by specific circumstances. For instance, an exceptional case could be the suicide of a well-known personality or celebrity, given that the publication would serve a social purpose or contribute to putting in place corrective measures. However, these exceptions too must be governed by all other provisions of the Code pertaining to suicide.
  
More specifically, in cases where the facts would justify deviation from the rule, the story must aim at information and not at sensationalism and should not contain details on the reasons or method, nor on the manner or means or process of the suicide. 

Even in cases where information is derived from a privileged procedure, such as public court hearings or statements by a person competent to talk about this particular issue, such information must not be published.

There are powerful indications that the Mass Media contribute considerably to the social phenomenon of suicide which is regarded by the World Health Organization as a serious public health problem. The WHO and the International Association for Suicide Prevention-IASP have published a special report addressed to media professionals, which brings together the findings of 50 investigations conducted worldwide: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Suicide_and_the_Media/

All investigations have drawn the conclusion that media reporting on suicides can lead to imitative suicidal behaviours immediately after the reporting and within a period of three weeks after.

The general conclusion of these reviews is that similarity between the stimulus and the person described in the story and the reader/viewer in terms of age, gender, financial or personal circumstances and other elements of identification, is an important factor of imitation.

It has also been noted that the more known or influential the person who had committed suicide, the broader was the imitating behaviour that followed. Particular subgroups, such as young people or people suffering from depression, may be especially vulnerable to engaging in imitative suicidal behaviours. The description of suicide by a particular method may lead to imitation of that method.

Where particular circumstances justify media reporting on suicide, the report must not give a simplistic account of the reasons which have led to the suicide. It would be misleading to attribute a suicide to an individual event like exam failure, relationship breakdown or economic catastrophe without delving into other factors. Suicide is never the result of a single cause. Mental disorders, impulsiveness, cultural, genetic and socio-economic factors always need to be taken into account.

According to the aforementioned study, instead of sensationalizing suicide, the mass media should rather have a deterrent effect by presenting the negative consequences of suicide. Such consequences is the devastating impact of suicide on family members and friends who mourn their loss and feel stigmatized and angry or even guilty, wondering whether there had been signs they may have missed.


**7. Presentation of topics about migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and human trafficking victims**

As a general principle, everyone in Cyprus, independent of national, racial, religious, social or linguistic background, has exactly the same human rights based on the international human rights treaties ratified by the Republic of Cyprus.

Recognizing this fact, the Code of Journalists' Practice forbids 'any action containing elements of prejudice based on race, colour, language, religion, political or other convictions, national or social background, property, origin, age, gender and personal status, including physical or mental illness or disability'. 

Further, the Code forbids as unacceptable the mocking, pillorying and derision of individuals or groups. This particular provision covers individuals and groups or subgroups of people with different racial, national, linguistic and religious characteristics, as well as characteristics pertaining to personal status, including personal details and features.

The aforementioned properties refer to the individual's right to be different, which must be recognized in practice and be respected by all.

Where issues of migration and asylum are presented by the Mass Media in a manner which contains prejudice regarding the aforementioned properties, the result is the creation of xenophobic feelings which goes on to exacerbate social phenomena rooted on the intolerance of diversity. 

An example of the Mass Media creating prejudice is reference to national and racial origin when these characteristics do not form substantial elements of the story. This particular practice is mostly observed in stories concerning crimes or offences or for any other reason reflecting negatively on individuals or groups, where the national or racial origin or solely the fact that the perpetrator or victim is not a Cypriot is underlined in the report. Conversely, in similar cases regarding Cypriots, nationality is not considered part of the story and is almost never mentioned. This particular practice contributes to the creation of feelings of xenophobia, hostility, revulsion and intolerance against foreigners as a whole. 

In the same manner, other rights of migrants are often violated, though respected for Cypriots. For instance, the violation of the presumption of innocence, the publication of photographs taken during their arrest or transfer to court, their right to privacy and non-disclosure of personal details.

Oftentimes, xenophobic statements are published and broadcasted because on several occasions they are made by well-known persons, as was repeatedly the case during live discussions or statements made on TV and radio stations; or allegations are put forward by members of the public, usually without allowing arguments to the contrary or the other perspective to be heard. 

When reporting on issues pertaining to migration sympathy must be shown to people forced to risk their own lives or the lives of their children for a better life. The obligation of states to provide refugees with help and protection must also be displayed, as well as positive actions, such as the rescue of 350 Syrian refugees in September 2014.

The current circumstances of economic crisis and increased unemployment favour a breeding ground for the creation and dissemination of feelings of xenophobia, racism and hostility against migrants. This requires media professionals to be especially cautious when handling stories about migrants, more particularly about asylum seekers, refugees, human trafficking victims and other groups residing in Cyprus or elsewhere.

Journalists who respect their profession and are fully aware of their mission owe to consciously make sure that no element of prejudice against migrants interferes with their work; at the same time they should point out the positive aspects of the migrants' presence in Cyprus.

Therefore, journalists should always bear in mind that this is not a one-dimensional topic; it is in fact complex and should not be treated simplistically in a manner that may lead to xenophobia. 

Lumping foreigners together - often under the term illegal immigrants - and putting forward largely uncritical allegations is the worst possible practice.


**IN SUMMARY:

Always take into account the element of diversity, be it cultural, racial, national, religious, social or visual in order to promote mutual understanding amongst different groups of the population.

Do not declare national or racial origin in news reports when this is not a component of information. For example, if you would not mention that the party or parties involved in a story are Cypriots, opt not to mention it where they are migrants. 

Neither write nor report news about events involving migrants, refugees, asylum seekers or human trafficking victims, where such events would not be newsworthy if they involved Cypriots. 

Do not overpublicize news where either the victims or the perpetrators are migrants. Treat these stories as you would if the persons involved were Cypriots.

Especially in cases of crimes or offences, do not refer to the suspect's or suspects' national origin, if it is not a constitutive or necessary element of the story.

Do not violate the presumption of innocence or give information concerning the private life or personal status of the persons involved or members of their family.

Reference to the origin, religion and legal status of migrants must be avoided unless it contributes to the understanding of the events. (The title 'Illegal migrant steals motorcycle' places major importance to the legal status of the individual as explanation for the theft, whereas the reason for the theft might have been irrelevant to the person's legal status).

Do not use levelling expressions and terms and avoid using belittling expressions and characterizations. 

Do not refer to all foreigners as illegal immigrants or in a derogatory manner.

When referring to migrants, specify whether they are economic migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, irregular migrants, trafficking victims or individuals under the protection of the state for any reason.

The term suggested by international human rights organizations for migrants arriving or residing in a country without legal documents is 'irregular migrants' or 'undocumented migrants'.

Journalism ethics requires the use of a legally correct terminology as cited herein below:

Asylum seeker is a person outside his or her country of origin who has applied for protection as a refugee or for international protection of some other kind. The asylum seeker, regardless of whether he or she has entered the country without documents or in any other irregular manner, has the right to remain in the country which has a responsibility to examine the application lodged by the asylum seeker, until a final decision is made.

Refugee is a person granted refugee status based on the 1951 Geneva Convention which has been ratified by 148 countries. Based on Article 1 of the Convention, the term ‘refugee' applies to any person who 'due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country'. The status of refugee may be granted to persons fulfilling the aforementioned criteria. 

Subsidiary Protection Beneficiary is granted to asylum seekers who do not run a risk of individual persecution in their country of origin based on the Geneva Convention, but cannot return to their country because they run a real risk of suffering serious harm - torture, the death penalty, inhumane or humiliating treatment, serious threat against their life - due to conflict or generalized violence.

A human trafficking victim is a person who is the subject of exploitation, whether it be labour, sexual or physical exploitation, such as removal of body organs, by other individuals exercising complete control over him or her.

As opposed to irregular migrants who of their own accord trust smugglers in order to reach their destination, the human trafficking victim has either not consented to being transferred to another country or, even if he or she has consented to, their consent becomes nullified due to coercion and deception imposed on them as a result of the actions of human traffickers or the abusive treatment they had been subjected to or threatened to be subjected to.

A migrant is a person who on his or her own accord makes a choice to seek work with better economic conditions in another country. As opposed to a refugee, the migrant's life and liberty are not at risk and he or she may, if they so wish return to their own country.

An irregular migrant or 'undocumented migrant' is a person who enters a country without having undergone border checks or a person who remains in a country after his or her authorized stay has expired, or someone who remains in a country after a decree of expulsion has been issued against him or her.

Never reveal the identity of asylum seekers, refugees, victims of human trafficking, even migrants who choose to speak on camera because either they or their relatives may face retaliation by the authorities of their country of origin or by non-State, even criminal organizations. 

Images of asylum seekers and human trafficking victims must not be shown. If special circumstances justify the publication/broadcast of images, care must be taken not to reveal faces in a manner that renders them identifiable. 

Do not use standardized archival images (i.e. women wearing a headscarf or a veil, men in praying posture) for stories about migrants. Not all migrants are Muslims or practicing Muslims, whereas the use of stereotypes may conjure up negative associations.

When handling cases of women who have fallen victims to human trafficking, do not convey the impression that these women are prostituted on their own accord and make sure you point out the fact that they are subjected to inhumane exploitation. Never mention their national or racial origin and always protect their anonymity. 

If you are hosting a TV program or a radio program, be prepared to intervene immediately and effectively in order to separate your own position and the position of the Media employing you if your guests, regardless of who they may be, make statements that contain the element of hostility or prejudice against migrants. Strongly deprecate such statements when made by public figures, individuals in positions of authority and persons who owing to their capacity exert influence on the public opinion.

Avoid sensationalism and the creation of feelings of fear, panic or concern over the consequences of migration if the allegations put forward lack a serious and well-founded documentation. 

When circumstances necessitate the publication of statements of unfavourable content for migrants, make sure you present the other point of view, asking for comments by an organization promoting the rights of migrants, or ask migrants themselves to comment on the statements.

Journalists employed by online news sites must be especially cautious, as the Internet leaves more room for a racist rhetoric. 

Online news sites ought to immediately remove racist comments, regardless of where they come from.

When asking for statements by foreigners, make sure they understand your questions and that you have correctly perceived their answers.

Inform foreigners of the possible consequences of their statements: when agreeing to make a statement they may not be aware of the international dynamics of the Press and therefore may not predict the consequences of their appearance in the Mass Media.

<p><em>Guidelines for journalistic work as recommended by the German Press Council</em></p>
<p><em>Drawn up by the Deutscher Presserat (German Press Council) in collaboration with the Press associations</em>
<em>and presented to Federal President Gustav W. Heinemann on 12 December 1973 in Bonn.</em></p>
<p><em>Version of 22.03.2017</em></p>
<h3 id=""preamble"">PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>The freedom of the Press enshrined in the Basic Law includes the independence and freedom of information, the right of expression and criticism. Publishers, editors and journalists must in their work remain aware of their responsibility towards the public and their duty to uphold the prestige of the Press. They perform their journalistic task fairly, according to the best of their knowledge and belief, uninfluenced by personal interests and motives that have nothing to do with the matter in hand.</p>
<p>The journalistic principles define the professional ethics of the Press. These include the duty within the framework of the Constitution and constitutional laws to maintain the standing of the Press and speak up for the freedom of the Press.</p>
<p>
The regulations pertaining to editorial data protection apply to the Press in gathering, processing or using information about persons for journalistic-editorial purposes. From research to editing, publishing, documenting and storing these data, the Press must respect people's privacy and right to self-determination on information about them. 
</p>
<p>
These professional ethics give everyone the right to complain about the Press. Complaints are justified if professional ethics are infringed. This preamble is part of the ethical standards.</p>
<h2 id=""section-1"">Section 1</h2>
<p><strong>TRUTHFULNESS AND PRESERVING HUMAN DIGNITY</strong></p>
<p>
Respect for the truth, preservation of human dignity and accurate informing of the public are the overriding principles of the Press. In this way, every person active in the Press preserves the standing and credibility of the media.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-1-1"">GUIDELINE 1.1</h3>
<p><strong>EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The informing of the public about events which are of general interest and importance for forming of public opinion and intent, must not be restricted or prevented by exclusive agreements with informants or shielding of them. Those who seek a monopoly on information exclude the rest of the Press from acquiring important news and thus impinge upon the freedom of information.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-1-2"">GUIDELINE 1.2</h3>
<p><strong>ELECTION CAMPAIGN REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>Accurate informing of the public during election campaigns includes the Press reporting on opinions that it does not share.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-1-3"">GUIDELINE 1.3</h3>
<p><strong>PRESS RELEASES</strong></p>
<p>Press releases must be identified as such if they are published by the editorial team without any further editing.</p>
<h2 id=""section-2"">Section 2</h2>
<p><strong>CARE</strong></p>
<p>Research is an indispensable instrument of journalistic due diligence. The publication of specific information in word, picture and graphics must be carefully checked in respect of accuracy in the light of existing circumstances. Its sense must not be distorted or falsified by editing, title or picture captions. Unconfirmed reports, rumours or assumptions must be quoted as such.</p>
<p>Symbolic photos must be clearly marked as such.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-1"">GUIDELINE 2.1</h3>
<p><strong>OPINION POLL FINDINGS</strong></p>
<p>When publishing the results of opinion polls, the Press shall give the number of respondents, the date of the poll, the identity of the person or organisation that commissioned it, and the questions asked. At the
same time, it must also state whether the results are representative.</p>
<p>If the institute was not commissioned to carry out the poll, it should be pointed out that it was implemented at the initiative of the institute itself.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-2"">GUIDELINE 2.2</h3>
<p><strong>SYMBOLIC PHOTOGRAPHS</strong></p>
<p>If an illustration, especially a photograph, can be taken to be a documentary picture by the casual reader, although it is a symbolic photograph, this must be clarified. For this reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>substitute or auxiliary illustrations (i.e. a similar subject at a different time, or a different subject at the same time, etc.),</li>
<li>symbolic illustrations (reconstructed scenes, artificially visualised events to accompany text, etc.),</li>
<li>photomontages or other changes </li>
</ul>
<p>must be clearly marked as such either in the caption or in the accompanying text.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-3"">GUIDELINE 2.3</h3>
<p><strong>ADVANCE REPORTS</strong></p>
<p>The Press bears full journalistic responsibility for advance reports published in a compressed form which announce a forthcoming story. Anyone who further distributes advance reports by Press organs by stating the source must, basically, be able to rely on their validity. Abridgements or additions must not lead to a situation where the basic elements of the story are given a new slant or prompt incorrect conclusions which may harm the legitimate interests of third parties.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-4"">GUIDELINE 2.4</h3>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWS</strong></p>
<p>A verbatim interview is absolutely journalistically correct if it correctly relays what has been said.</p>
<p>If the text of an interview is quoted in full or in part, the publication concerned must state its source. If the basic content of verbally expressed thoughts is paraphrased, it is nonetheless a matter of journalistic honour to state the source.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-5"">GUIDELINE 2.5</h3>
<p><strong>GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The duty of care requires misleading distortions be excluded in graphical representations.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-6"">GUIDELINE 2.6</h3>
<p><strong>READERS' LETTERS</strong></p>
<p>
1) The Press Code must be observed when publishing readers' letters. It is in the interest of informing the public to allow opinions not shared by the editorial team to be expressed in the Readers' Letters section. 2) Correspondence with publishers or editorial departments can be printed as readers' letters if it is clear, due to their form and content, that this is in accordance with the sender's wishes. Consent may be assumed if the letter refers to articles published by the newspaper or magazine concerned or to matters of general interest. The authors of such readers' letters have no legal right to have them published. 3) It is common practice that readers' letters are published with the author's name. Only in exceptional cases can, at the request of the author, another designation be used. When printing, the Press shall refrain from publishing addresses unless publication of the address serves to respect justified interests. If there is any doubt about the identity of the sender, a letter should not be printed. When taking over user-generated content (Guideline 2.7) in the form of readers' letters, pseudonyms may be retained. However, the source must be indicated. The publication of fake readers' letters is not compatible with the duties of the Press. 4) Changes or abridgements of letters are fundamentally impermissible without the author's consent. However, abridgements are possible if the Readers' Letters section contains a regular notice that the editor reserves the right to shorten such letters without changing the meaning of them. Should the sender expressly forbid changes or abridgements, the editorial department must either comply with that wish, even if it has reserved the right to abridgement, or decline to publish the letter. 5) All readers' letters sent to the editor are subject to editorial secrecy. They must never be passed on to third parties.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-2-7"">GUIDELINE 2.7</h3>
<p><strong>USER-GENERATED CONTENT</strong></p>
<p>The Press bears responsibility for all its publications, including user-generated content. User-generated content must be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>Editors shall ensure compliance with journalistic principles if they detect violations through user-generated content or if such violations are pointed out to them by third parties. In the event that editors select or edit individual user-generated content, compliance with journalistic principles must be ensured from the outset.</p>
<h2 id=""section-3"">Section 3</h2>
<p><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Published news or assertions, in particular those of a personal nature, which subsequently turn out to be incorrect must be promptly rectified in an appropriate manner by the publication concerned.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-3-1"">GUIDELINE 3.1</h3>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
The reader must be able to recognise that the previous article was wholly or partly incorrect. For this reason a correction publishing the true facts must also refer to the incorrect article. The true facts are to be published even if the error has already been publicly admitted in another way.
</li>
<li>In the case of online publications the rectification is to be linked to the original content. If the rectification is made within the publication itself, it must be marked as such.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""guideline-3-2"">GUIDELINE 3.2</h3>
<p><strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong></p>
<p>
If journalistic-editorial research, processing or use of person-related data results in the Press having to publish corrections, retractions, refutations by the persons concerned or to a reprimand by the German Press Council, the publication involved must store them along with the original data and document them for the same period as the original data.
</p>
<h2 id=""section-4"">Section 4</h2>
<p><strong>LIMITS OF RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>Dishonest methods must not be used to acquire person-related news, information or photographs.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-4-1"">GUIDELINE 4.1</h3>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>
Journalists must, as a fundamental principle, identify themselves as such. Untrue statements by a journalist about his/her identity and their publication when doing research work are fundamentally irreconcilable with the standing and function of the Press. 
</p>
<p>Undercover research may be justifiable in individual cases if in this way information of particular public interest is gained which cannot be procured by other means.</p>
<p>In the event of accidents and natural disasters, the Press must bear in mind that emergency services for the victims and those in danger have priority over the public right to information.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-4-2"">GUIDELINE 4.2</h3>
<p><strong>RESEARCH AMONG PEOPLE REQUIRING PROTECTION</strong></p>
<p>When conducting research among people requiring protection, particular restraint is called for. This applies especially to people who are not in full possession of their mental or physical powers or who have been exposed to an extremely emotional situation, as well as to children and juveniles. The limited willpower or the special situation of such people must not be exploited deliberately to gain information.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-4-3"">GUIDELINE 4.3</h3>
<p><strong>BLOCKING OR DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>
Personal data gathered in violation of the Press Code are to be blocked or deleted by the publication involved.
</p>
<h2 id=""section-5"">Section 5</h2>
<p><strong>PROFESSIONAL SECRECY</strong></p>
<p>
The Press shall respect professional secrecy, make use of the right to refuse to bear witness and shall not reveal informants' identities without their explicit permission. Confidentiality is to be adhered to in principle.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-5-1"">GUIDELINE 5.1</h3>
<p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>
<p>Should an informant stipulate, as a condition for the use of his/her report, that he/she remain unrecognisable or unendangered as the source, this is to be respected. Confidentiality can be non-binding only if the information concerns a crime and there is a duty to inform the police. Confidentiality may also be lifted if, in carefully weighing interests, important reasons of state predominate, particularly if the constitutional order is affected or jeopardised.</p>
<p>Actions and plans described as secret may be reported if after careful consideration it is determined that the public's need to know outweighs the reasons put forward to justify secrecy.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-5-2"">GUIDELINE 5.2</h3>
<p><strong>SECRET SERVICE ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>Secret service activities by journalists and publishers are irreconcilable with the duties stemming from professional secrecy and the prestige of the Press.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-5-3"">GUIDELINE 5.3</h3>
<p><strong>DATA TRANSFER</strong></p>
<p>All person-related data gathered, processed and used for journalistic-editorial purposes are subject to editorial secrecy. Transfer of such data between editorial departments is permissible. It is not to be done until conclusion of a formal complaint procedure under data protection law. A data transfer is to be annotated with the remark that the data is to be edited or used only for journalistic-editorial purposes.</p>
<h2 id=""section-6"">Section 6</h2>
<p><strong>SEPARATION OF ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>Journalists and publishers shall not perform any activities that could throw doubt over the credibility of the Press.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-6-1"">GUIDELINE 6.1</h3>
<p><strong>DUAL FUNCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Should a journalist or publisher exercise another function in addition to his or her journalistic activity, for example in a government, a public authority or a business enterprise, all those involved must take care strictly to separate these functions. The same applies in reverse.</p>
<h2 id=""section-7"">Section 7</h2>
<p><strong>SEPARATION OF ADVERTISING AND EDITORIAL CONTENT</strong></p>
<p>
The responsibility of the Press towards the general public requires that editorial publications are not influenced by the private or business interests of third parties or the personal economic interests of the journalists. Publishers and editors must reject any attempts of this nature and make a clear distinction between editorial and commercial content. If a publication concerns the publisher's own interests, this must be clearly identifiable.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-7-1"">GUIDELINE 7.1</h3>
<p><strong>DISTINCTION BETWEEN EDITORIAL TEXT AND ADVERTISEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Paid publications must be so designed that the reader can recognise advertising as such. They can be separated from the editorial section by means of identification and/or design. Furthermore, regulations under advertising law apply.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-7-2"">GUIDELINE 7.2</h3>
<p><strong>SURREPTITIOUS ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>
Editorial stories that refer to companies, their products, services or events must not overstep the boundary to surreptitious advertising. This risk is especially great if a story goes beyond justified public interest or the reader's interest in information or is paid for by a third part or is rewarded by advantages with a monetary value.
</p>
<p>The credibility of the Press as a source of information demands particular care when handling PR material.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-7-3"">GUIDELINE 7.3</h3>
<p><strong>SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Editorial special publications are subject to the same editorial responsibility as all other editorial content.
Advertising special publications must respect the requirements of Guideline 7.1.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-7-4"">GUIDELINE 7.4</h3>
<p><strong>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>Journalists and publishers who research or receive information within the context of exercising their profession shall use this information prior to publication only for journalistic purposes and not for their own personal advantage or the personal advantage of others. </p>
<p>Journalists and publishers may not publish any reports about securities and/or their issuers with the intention of enriching themselves, their family members or other close persons through the price development of the security in question. They should not buy or sell securities, either directly or through agents, on which they have published something in the previous two weeks or on which they are planning to report in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>
Journalists and publishers shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with these regulations. Conflicts of interest in drawing up or passing on financial analyses shall be revealed in an appropriate manner.
</p>
<h2 id=""section-8"">Section 8</h2>
<p><strong>PROTECTION OF THE PERSONALITY</strong></p>
<p>The Press shall respect the private life of a person and his/her right to self-determination about personal information. However, if a person's behaviour is of public interest, it may be discussed by the Press. In the case of identifying reporting, the public interest in information must outweigh the interests worthy of protection of the persons involved; sensational interests alone do not justify identifying reporting. As far
as an anonymization is required, it must be effective.</p>
<p>The Press guarantees editorial data protection.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-1"">GUIDELINE 8.1</h3>
<p><strong>CRIMINAL REPORTING</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The public has a legitimate interest in being informed about crimes, investigation proceedings and trials. It is the task of the Press to report on these issues.</li>
<li>
The Press shall only publish names, photographs and other information enabling the identification of suspects or perpetrators if the legitimate interest of the public outweighs the interests worthy of protection of the persons involved in the individual case. Factors that are to be taken into account in particular are: the intensity of the suspicion, the seriousness of the allegation, the state of proceedings, the suspect's or perpetrator's degree of fame, the suspect's or perpetrator's earlier behaviour and the intensity with which he/she seeks publicity. In general, a prevailing public interest may be assumed if:<ul>
<li>the crime in question is extremely serious or special in terms of its type and dimension;</li>
<li>there is a connection resp. a contradiction between office, mandate, social role or function of a person and the action he/she is accused of;</li>
<li>
there is a connection between a famous person's position and the crime he/she is accused of or if the crime the person is accused of is contrary to his/her public image;
</li>
<li>a serious crime was committed publicly;</li>
<li>an arrest warrant has been applied for by the investigating authorities. If there are reasons to believe that a suspect is deemed to be incapable of committing a crime, the press shall refrain from identifying reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the case of renewed reporting on criminal proceedings lying in the past, as a rule no name or picture
of the perpetrator should be published in the interest of resocialisation. The resocialisation interest is all the greater, the longer the time period that has passed since the conviction.</li>
<li>In the case of persons involved in the administration of justice, such as judges, prosecuting attorneys,
lawyers and expert witnesses, identifying reporting is permissible as a rule if the persons in question are exercising their functions. </li>
</ol>
<p>Publication of the names or photographs of witnesses is generally inadmissible.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-2"">GUIDELINE 8.2</h3>
<p><strong>PROTECTION OF VICTIMS</strong></p>
<p>
Victims have the right to special protection of their identity. Knowledge about the victim's identity is generally irrelevant for understanding an accident occurrence, the circumstances of a disaster or crime. Publication of the name and photograph of a victim is permissible if the victim resp. the relatives or other authorized persons have given their consent or if the victim is a public figure.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-3"">GUIDELINE 8.3</h3>
<p><strong>CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>
In particular with regard to reporting on crimes and accidents, as a rule the identification of children and young people is inadmissible before completion of their 18th year.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-4"">GUIDELINE 8.4</h3>
<p><strong>RELATIVES AND THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>
In the case of relatives and other persons who are indirectly affected by a publication and have nothing to do with the actual object of reporting, the publication of names and photographs is generally impermissible.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-5"">GUIDELINE 8.5</h3>
<p><strong>MISSING PERSONS</strong></p>
<p>The names and photographs of missing persons may be published, however only in agreement with the responsible authorities.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-6"">GUIDELINE 8.6</h3>
<p><strong>ILLNESSES</strong></p>
<p>
Physical and mental illnesses or injuries are part of a person's private sphere. As a rule the press should refrain from reporting about illnesses or injuries without the consent of the affected persons.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-7"">GUIDELINE 8.7</h3>
<p><strong>SUICIDE</strong></p>
<p>Reporting on suicide calls for restraint. This applies in particular to the publication of names and photographs and the description of the particular circumstances.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-8"">GUIDELINE 8.8</h3>
<p><strong>LOCATION</strong></p>
<p>The private address as well as other private locations, such as hospitals, care facilities, rehabilitation centres enjoy special protection.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-9"">GUIDELINE 8.9</h3>
<p><strong>ANNIVERSARY DATES</strong>
The publication of anniversary dates of persons who are otherwise not in the public eye requires that the editorial department confirms in advance whether those involved consent to the publication or not.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-10"">GUIDELINE 8.10</h3>
<p><strong>INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>If a press report has a negative effect on someone's personal rights, on request the affected person must be given information about the respective personal data stored by the responsible publication organ. The information may be declined if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data is indicative of the names of persons who are collaborating or have collaborated in the research, processing or publishing of contributions as part of their journalistic work;</li>
<li>the data is indicative of the names of contributors, guarantors or informants of contributions, documents and reports for the editorial section;</li>
<li>imparting the data obtained by research or other means would negatively affect the publication organ's journalistic mission by revealing the information it possesses; or</li>
<li>it otherwise proves to be necessary in order to conciliate the right to privacy with the applicable regulations regarding the freedom of expression.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""guideline-8-11"">GUIDELINE 8.11</h3>
<p><strong>OPPOSITION AND ESCAPE</strong></p>
<p>In reports on countries where opposition to the government can mean danger to life and limb, the Press must always consider whether, by publishing names or photographs, those involved may be identified and persecuted. Furthermore, the publication of details concerning escapees and their escape may result in relatives and friends who are still in the escapees homelands being endangered, or in still-existing escape-routes being closed.</p>
<h2 id=""section-9"">Section 9</h2>
<p><strong>PROTECTION OF DIGNITY</strong></p>
<p>
Violating people's dignity with inappropriate representations in word and image contradicts journalistic ethics.
</p>
<h2 id=""section-10"">Section 10</h2>
<p><strong>RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, CUSTOM</strong></p>
<p>The Press will refrain from vituperating against religious, philosophical or moral convictions.</p>
<h2 id=""section-11"">Section 11</h2>
<p><strong>SENSATIONAL REPORTING, THE PROTECTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>The Press will refrain from inappropriately sensational portrayal of violence, brutality and suffering. The Press shall respect the protection of young people.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-1"">GUIDELINE 11.1</h3>
<p><strong>INAPPROPRIATE PORTRAYAL</strong></p>
<p>
A report is inappropriately sensational if the person it covers is reduced to an object, to a mere thing. This is particularly so if reports about a dying or physically or mentally suffering person go beyond public interest and the readers' requirement for information. When placing pictorial representations of acts of violence and accidents on front pages, the Press shall respect the possible effects on children and young people.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-2"">GUIDELINE 11.2</h3>
<p><strong>REPORTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE</strong></p>
<p>
In reporting actual and threatened acts of violence, the Press should weigh carefully the public's interest in information against the interests of the victims and other people involved. It should report on such incidents in an independent and authentic way, but not allow itself to be made the tool of criminals. Nor should it undertake independent attempts to mediate between criminals and the police.
</p>
<p>There must be no interviews with perpetrators during acts of violence.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-3"">GUIDELINE 11.3</h3>
<p><strong>ACCIDENTS AND DISASTERS</strong></p>
<p>
The limit of acceptability in reports on accidents and disasters is respect for the suffering of the victims and the feelings of their dependants. Victims of misfortune must not be made to suffer a second time by their portrayal in the media.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-4"">GUIDELINE 11.4</h3>
<p><strong>CO-ORDINATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES/NEWS 'BLACKOUTS'</strong></p>
<p>In principle, the Press does not accept news 'blackouts'. Co-ordination between the media and the police shall occur only if the action of journalists can protect or save the life and health of victims and other involved persons. The Press shall comply with police requests for a partial or total news embargo for a certain period of time in the interest of solving crime, if the request is justified convincingly.</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-5"">GUIDELINE 11.5</h3>
<p><strong>CRIMINALS' MEMOIRS</strong></p>
<p>The publication of so-called criminals' memoirs infringes journalistic principles if crimes are justified or qualified with hindsight, the victims are inappropriately affected, and a detailed description of the crime merely satisfies the demand for sensation.
</p>
<h3 id=""guideline-11-6"">GUIDELINE 11.6</h3>
<p><strong>DRUGS</strong></p>
<p>Press stories must not play down drug abuse.</p>
h2>Section 12</h2>
<p><strong>DISCRIMINATION</strong></p>
<p>There must be no discrimination against a person because of his/her sex, a disability or his membership of an ethnic, religious, social or national group.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE 12.1</h3>
<p><strong>REPORTING ON CRIMES</strong></p>
<p>When reporting on crimes, it must be ensured that any reference to a suspect's or perpetrator's membership of ethnic, religious or other minority groups does not result in a discriminatory generalisation of individual misconduct. As a rule, membership of a minority group shall not be mentioned, unless this is in the legitimate interest of the general public. In particular, it must be borne in mind that such references could stir up prejudices against minorities.</p>
<h2>Section 13</h2>
<p><strong>PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE</strong></p>
<p>Reports on investigations, criminal court proceedings and other formal procedures must be free from prejudice. The principle of the presumption of innocence also applies to the Press.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.1</h3>
<p><strong>PREJUDICE</strong></p>
<p>Reports on investigations and court cases serve to inform the public in a careful way about crimes and other infringements of the law, their prosecution and court judgement. In the process it must not prejudge them. The Press may call a person a perpetrator if he/she has made a confession and there is also evidence against him/her or if he/she committed the crime in public view. In the language of reporting, the Press is not required to use legal terms that are irrelevant to the reader.</p>
<p>In a state based on the rule of law, the aim of court reporting must not be to punish convicted criminals socially as well by using the media as a 'pillory'. Reports should make a clear distinction between suspicion and proven guilt.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.2</h3>
<p><strong>FOLLOW-ON REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>If the Press has reported on the unconfirmed conviction of a person, it should also report an ensuing acquittal or a marked lessening of charges if the legitimate interests of the person affected do not dictate to the contrary. This recommendation also applies to the dropping of an investigation.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE 13.3</h3>
<p><strong>CRIMES COMMITTED BY YOUNG PERSONS</strong></p>
<p>When reporting on investigations and criminal court proceedings against young persons and on their appearance in court, the Press must exercise especial restraint out of consideration for their future.</p>
<h2>Section 14</h2>
<p><strong>MEDICAL REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>Reports on medical matters should not be of an unnecessarily sensationalist nature since they might lead to unfounded hopes or fears on the part of some readers. Research findings that are still at an early stage should not be portrayed as if they were conclusive or almost conclusive.</p>
<h2>Section 15</h2>
<p><strong>PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT</strong></p>
<p>The acceptance of privileges of any kind that could possibly influence the freedom of decision on the part of publishers and editors are irreconcilable with the prestige, independence and responsibilities of the
Press. Anyone accepting bribes for the dissemination of news acts in a dishonourably and unprofessional manner.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINE 15.1</h3>
<p><strong>INVITATIONS AND GIFTS</strong></p>
<p>Even the appearance that the freedom of decision of a publishing house and its editorial staff can be impaired is to be avoided. Journalists shall therefore not accept any invitations or gifts whose value exceeds the extent that is usual in business and necessary as part of working life. </p>
<p>The acceptance of advertising articles or other low-value objects is harmless.</p>
<p>Research and reporting must not be influenced, hindered or even prevented by the accepting of gifts, invitations or discounts. Publishing houses and journalists shall insist that information be given regardless of the acceptance of a gift or an invitation.</p>
<p>If journalists report on Press trips to which they have been invited, they shall make this financing clear.</p>
<h2>Section 16</h2>
<p><strong>PUBLICATION OF REPRIMANDS</strong></p>
<p>It is considered fair reporting when a public reprimand issued by the German Press Council is published, especially by the publication or telecommunications media concerned.</p>

<h1>The Press Ethical Rules</h1>
<h2>Sound Press Ethics</h2>
<p>The content and conduct of the media shall be in accordance with sound press ethics (Section 34(1) of the Media Liability Act).</p>
<p>The Press Council determines whether the conduct of the media is contrary to sound press ethics. Its decision is based on the 'Advisory rules of sound press ethics' which formed part of the Media Liability Bill of 1991, but the 'sound press ethics' standard keeps pace with developments in determination of what is unethical, and adopts standpoints on new situations that arise.</p>
<p><em>'The advisory rules of sound press ethics were revised on 22 May 2013'</em></p>
<p>(Adopted at the meeting of delegates of the Danish Union of Journalists on 23-24 April 2013 and at the annual general meeting of the Association of the Danish Media on 22 May 2013).</p>
<h2>Fundamental views</h2>
<p>Safeguarding the freedom of speech in Denmark is closely connected with the free access of the media to collect information and news and to publish it as correctly as possible. Free comment is part of the exercise of the freedom of speech. In attending to these tasks the media should recognise that the individual citizen is entitled to respect for his/her personal integrity as well as the sanctity of his/her private life and the need for protection against unjustified violation hereof. Visible and clear guidance on how to complain of media content and conduct shoud be made available by the media.</p>
<p>Breach of sound press ethics also includes the withholding of rightful publication of information of essential importance to the public and compliance with outsiders' demands for influence over the content of the media, if such compliance may raise doubt as to the freedom and independence of the media. Furthermore, a breach of sound press ethics exists if tasks that are in conflict with the present press ethical rules are imposed on a journalist.</p>
<p>Journalists should not have tasks imposed on them that are contrary to their conscience or convictions.</p>
<p>The rules cover the editorial materials published in the media. The rules also cover edited discussion contributions. If unedited discussion items are brought, visible and clear guidelines on such items should be published and an effective procedure for handling complaints of such items should be set up by the relevant medium.</p>
<p>The rules also cover advertisements and publicity in the printed periodical press and in the other media to the extent that specific rules governing these have not been laid down.</p>
<p>The rules apply to persons mentioned and depicted, including deceased persons, legal entities etc.</p>
<h2>Content of the rules</h2>
<h3>A. Correct information</h3>
<ol>
<li>It is the duty of the media to publish information correctly and promptly. As far as possible it should be verified whether the information given or reproduced is correct.</li>
<li>The sources of news should be treated critically, in particular when their statements may be coloured by personal interest or tortious intent.</li>
<li>Information which may be prejudicial or insulting or detract from the respect in which individuals should be held shall be very closely examined before publication, primarily by submission to the person concerned. Submission should be made so as to give the person concerned a reasonable time to reply.</li>
<li>Attacks and replies should, where this is reasonable, be published together and in the same way. This particularly applies to insulting or prejudicial statements.</li>
<li>A clear distinction shall be drawn between factual information and comments.</li>
<li>The form and content of headlines and subheadlines shall be substantiated by the article or publication in question. The same rule shall apply to newspaper placards.</li>
<li>Incorrect information shall be corrected on the editors' own initiative, if and as soon as knowledge of errors of importance in the published information is received. The correction shall be given in such a form that the readers, listeners or viewers may easily become aware of the correction.</li>
</ol>
<h3>B. Conduct contrary to sound press ethics</h3>
<ol>
<li>Information which may violate the sanctity of private life shall be avoided unless an obvious public interest requires public coverage. The individual is entitled to protection of his/her personal reputation.</li>
<li>Suicides or attempted suicides should not be mentioned unless an obvious public interest requires or justifies public coverage, and in that case the coverage should be as considerate as possible.</li>
<li>Victims of crimes or accidents shall be paid the greatest possible regard. The same rule applies to witnesses and the relatives of the persons concerned. Consideration and tact shall be shown in the collection and communication of pictorial material, including amateur photos.</li>
<li>A clear distinction shall be drawn between advertising and editorial content. Text, sound and images generated by direct or indirect commercial interests should be published only if a clear journalistic criterion calls for publication.</li>
<li>Special regard should be paid to children and other persons who cannot be expected to realise the effects of their statements or other involvement. Parental consent should be obtained before the publication of interviews or the like when indicated by the nature of the subject and the minor's age.</li>
<li>At the collection or publication of information, the confidence, feelings, ignorance, lack of experience or lack of self-control shoud not be abused.</li>
<li>Clandestine recordings should only be published if the persons involved have given their consent, or if the interests of society clearly supersede the claim for protection of the individual and it is not possible, or only possible with great difficulty, to obtain the necessary journalistic evidence in any other way.</li>
<li>Statements published in digital media will often be available long after their publication. Upon request to the medium, the availability of such previously published sensitive or private information may be hampered if possible and deemed reasonable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>C. Court reporting</h3>
<ol>
<li>The general Press Ethical Rules mentioned under A and B shall also apply to court reporting.</li>
<li>The rules for court reporting shall also apply to the preliminary steps of a lawsuit or a trial, including the consideration of criminal cases by the police and the prosecution.</li>
<li>Court reporting should be objective. At any time during the preliminary stages and the hearing by the court, the journalist should aim at a qualitatively equal representation of the points of view of the parties (in criminal cases the points of view of the prosecution and the defence, respectively).
Coverage of a criminal case should be followed up by an account of the conclusion of the case, whether this takes place in the form of a withdrawal of the charge, acquittal, or conviction.</li>
<li>Family circumstances, race, ethnicity, nationality, creed, sexual orientation or membership of organisations should only be mentioned when relevant to the case.</li>
<li>As long as a criminal case has not been finally decided or the charge withdrawn, no information may be published which may obstruct the clearing up of the case, nor may pronouncements to the effect that a suspect or accused is guilty be published. When reporting on a criminal case, it shall clearly appear whether a suspect or an accused has declared himself or herself guilty or not guilty.</li>
<li>To the greatest possible extent, a clear objective line shall be followed in deciding which cases are to be covered, and in which instances the names of the persons involved are to be given. The name or any other identification of a suspect or an accused should be omitted if no public interest calls for the publication of the name.</li>
<li>Caution should be exercised in publishing statements to the effect that information has been laid with the police against a person mentioned by name. Such information should as a rule not be published until the information laid has resulted in the intervention of the police or the prosecution. However, this rule shall not apply to statements referred to by the person informed against, or if the information laid is already widely known or is of considerable public interest, or if under the existing circumstances it must be assumed that the information laid was well-founded.</li>
<li>A suspect, an accused, or a convicted person should be spared from having attention called to an earlier conviction if it is without importance in relation to the offence concerning which he/she is now suspected, charged, or convicted. Previous criminal charges against a named person should not, as a rule, be mentioned in connection with other news.</li>

"16_ES";"Spain";"ES";"Ethics of journalism (Andalousia)";"<h1>Ethics of journalism</h1>
<p>Parliamentary Assembly</p>
<p>The Assembly affirms the following ethical principles for journalism and believes that they should be applied by the profession throughout Europe.</p>
<h3>News and opinions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to the legal rights and obligations set forth in the relevant legal norms, the media have an ethical responsibility towards citizens and society which must be underlined at the present time, when information and communication play a very important role in the formation of citizens' personal attitudes and the development of society and democratic life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist's profession comprises rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basic principle of any ethical consideration of journalism is that a clear distinction must be drawn between news and opinions, making it impossible to confuse them. News is information about facts and data, while opinions convey thoughts, ideas, beliefs or value judgments on the part of media companies, publishers or journalists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News broadcasting should be based on truthfulness, ensured by the appropriate means of verification and proof, and impartiality in presentation, description and narration. Rumour must not be confused with news. News headlines and summaries must reflect as closely as possible the substance of the facts and data presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expression of opinions may entail thoughts or comments on general ideas or remarks on news relating to actual events. Although opinions are necessarily subjective and therefore cannot and should not be made subject to the criterion of truthfulness, we must ensure that opinions are expressed honestly and ethically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opinions taking the form of comments on events or actions relating to individuals or institutions should not attempt to deny or conceal the reality of the facts or data. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The right to information as a fundamental human right - Publishers, proprietors and journalists</h3>
<ol start=""7"">
<li>
<p>The media's work is one of 'mediation', providing an information service, and the rights which they own in connection with freedom of information depends on its addressees, that is the citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information is a fundamental right which has been highlighted by the case-law of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights relating to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and recognised under Article 9 of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, as well as in all democratic constitutions. The owner of the right is the citizen, who also has the related right to demand that the information supplied by journalists be conveyed truthfully, in the case of news, and honestly, in the case of opinions, without outside interference by either the public authorities or the private sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public authorities must not consider that they own information. The representativeness of such authorities provides the legal basis for efforts to guarantee and extend pluralism in the media and to ensure that the necessary conditions are created for exercising freedom of expression and the right to information and precluding censorship. Moreover, the Committee of Ministers is aware of this fact, as demonstrated by its Declaration on the Freedom of Expression and Information adopted on 29 April 1982.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When dealing with journalism it must be borne in mind that it relies on the media, which are part of a corporate structure within which a distinction must be made between publishers, proprietors and journalists. To that end, in addition to safeguarding the freedom of the media, freedom within the media must also be protected and internal pressures guarded against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News organisations must consider themselves as special socio-economic agencies whose entrepreneurial objectives have to be limited by the conditions for providing access to a fundamental right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News organisations must show transparency in matters of media ownership and management, enabling citizens to ascertain clearly the identity of proprietors and the extent of their economic interest in the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the news organisation, publishers and journalists must co-exist, bearing in mind that the legitimate respect for publishers' and owners' ideological orientations is limited by the absolute requirements on truthful news reporting and ethical opinions. This is essential if we are to respect the citizens' fundamental right to information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These requirements are such that we must reinforce the safeguards of the journalist's freedom of expression, for they must in the last instance operate as the ultimate sources of information. In this connection we must legally expand and clarify the nature of the conscience clause and professional secrecy vis-a-vis confidential sources, harmonising national provisions on this matter so that they can be implemented in the wider context of democratic Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither publishers and proprietors nor journalists should consider that they own the news. News organisations must treat information not as a commodity but as a fundamental right of the citizen. To that end, the media should exploit neither the quality nor the substance of the news or opinions for purposes of boosting readership or audience figures in order to increase advertising revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are to ensure that information is treated ethically, its target audience must be considered as individuals and not as a mass. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The function of journalism and its ethical activity</h3>
<ol start=""17"">
<li>
<p>Information and communication as conveyed by journalism through the media, with powerful support from the new technologies, has decisive importance for the development of the individual and society. It is indispensable for democratic life, since if democracy is to develop fully it must guarantee citizens participation in public affairs. Suffice it to say that such participation would be impossible if the citizens were not in receipt of the information on public affairs which they need and which must be provided by the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of information, especially radio and television news, for culture and education was highlighted in Assembly Recommendation 1067. Its effects on public opinion are obvious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be wrong to infer from the importance of this role that the media actually represent public opinion or that they should replace the specific functions of the public authorities or institutions of an educational or cultural character such as schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would amount to transforming the media and journalism into authorities or counter-authorities ('mediocracy'), even though they would not be representative of the citizens or subject to the same democratic controls as the public authorities, and would not possess the specialist knowledge of the corresponding cultural or educational institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore journalism should not alter truthful, impartial information or honest opinions, or exploit them for media purposes, in an attempt to create or shape public opinion, since its legitimacy rests on effective respect for the citizen's fundamental right to information as part of respect for democratic values. To that end, legitimate investigative journalism is limited by the veracity and honesty of information and opinions and is incompatible with journalistic campaigns conducted on the basis of previously adopted positions and special interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In journalism, information and opinions must respect the presumption of innocence, in particular in cases which are still sub judice, and must refrain from making judgments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right of individuals to privacy must be respected. Persons holding office in public life are entitled to protection for their privacy except in those cases where their private life may have an effect on their public life. The fact that a person holds a public post does not deprive him of the right to respect for his privacy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attempt to strike a balance between the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the freedom of expression set forth in Article 10, is well documented in the recent case-law of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the journalist's profession the end does not justify the means; therefore information must be obtained by legal and ethical means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the request of the persons concerned, the news media must correct, automatically and speedily, and with all relevant information provided, any news item or opinion conveyed by them which is false or erroneous. National legislation should provide for appropriate sanctions and, where applicable, compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to harmonise the application and exercise of this right in the member states of the Council of Europe, we must implement Resolution (74) 26 on the right of reply _ Position of the individual in relation to the press, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 2 July 1974, and also the relevant provisions of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to ensure high-quality work and independence on the part of journalists, they must be guaranteed decent pay and proper working conditions and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the relations which the journalist must maintain in the course of his duties with the public authorities or the various economic sectors, care should be taken to avoid any kind of connivance liable to affect the independence and impartiality of journalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In journalism, controversial or sensational items must not be confused with subjects on which it is important to provide information. The journalist must not exploit his duties for the principal purpose of acquiring prestige or personal influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In view of the complexity of the process of providing information, which is increasingly based on the use of new technologies, speed and conciseness, journalists must be required to have appropriate professional training.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rules governing editorial staff</h3>
<ol start=""32"">
<li>Within the newspaper business, publishers, proprietors and journalists must live side by side. To that end, rules must be drawn up for editorial staff in order to regulate professional relations between the journalists and the publishers and proprietors within the media, separately from the normal requirements of labour relations. Such rules might provide for the setting up of editorial boards.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Situations of conflict and cases of special protection</h3>
<ol start=""33"">
<li>
<p>In society, situations of tension and conflict sometimes arise under the pressure of factors such as terrorism, discrimination against minorities, xenophobia or war. In such circumstances the media have a moral obligation to defend democratic values: respect for human dignity, solving problems by peaceful, tolerant means, and consequently to oppose violence and the language of hatred and confrontation and to reject all discrimination based on culture, sex or religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No-one should remain neutral vis-à-vis the defence of democratic values. To that end the media must play a major role in preventing tension and must encourage mutual understanding, tolerance and trust between the various communities in regions where conflict prevails, as the Secretary General of the Council of Europe has set out to do with her confidence-building measures in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having regard to the very specific influence of the media, notably television, on the attitudes of children and young people, care must be taken not to broadcast programmes, messages or images glorifying violence, exploiting sex and consumerism or using deliberately unsuitable language.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ethics and self-regulation in journalism</h3>
<ol start=""36"">
<li>
<p>Having regard to the requisite conditions and basic principles enumerated above, the media must undertake to submit to firm ethical principles guaranteeing freedom of expression and the fundamental right of citizens to receive truthful information and honest opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to supervise the implementation of these principles, self-regulatory bodies or mechanisms must be set up comprising publishers, journalists, media users' associations, experts from the academic world and judges; they will be responsible for issuing resolutions on respect for ethical precepts in journalism, with prior commitment on the part of the media to publish the relevant resolutions. This will help the citizen, who has the right to information, to pass either positive or negative judgment on the journalist's work and credibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The self-regulatory bodies or mechanisms, the media users' associations and the relevant university departments could publish each year the research done a posteriori on the truthfulness of the information broadcast by the media, comparing the news with the actual facts. This would serve as a barometer of credibility which citizens could use as a guide to the ethical standard achieved by each medium or each section of the media, or even each individual journalist. The relevant corrective mechanisms might simultaneously help improve the manner in which the profession of media journalism is pursued.</p>

<p><em>Declaration of Principles of Professional Journalists in Catalonia</em></p>

<p><strong>1. Report with accuracy and precision</strong></p>
<p>The professional journalists are committed to the pursuit of the truth and, consequently, they have the obligation to report the reality of the events with the highest fidelity possible. The media always have to maintain a clear distinction between fact and opinion, disclose only information that's been verified with due diligence and avoid spreading conjectures and rumours as if they were facts.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid harm due to information without sufficient basis</strong></p>
<p>The journalists should not use abusive expressions nor disclose facts that are imprecise or without sufficient basis and that may injure the dignity of people and cause harm or discredit to public or private entities. </p>
<p>The journalists must contact previously with those who could be affected, providing them the opportunity to reply.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rectify incorrect information</strong></p>
<p>The journalists have the obligation to amend both the information and the resulting interpretations that have been proven false or wrong, and that should be done promptly and with an appropriate treatment and extent. At the same time, the media must meet the right of reply when this is requested on reasonable terms.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use legitimate and worthy methods to obtain information</strong></p>
<p>The use of hidden cameras and any other surreptitious or misleading procedure to obtain information, pictures and testimonies is unacceptable. The interception and revelation without consent of private material obtained from mobile telephones, electronic messaging and other communication devices is also unacceptable. </p>
<p>An exemption could be granted in case of incidents or events of unequivocal public interest, when there is no other option left to comply appropriately with the right to information. </p>
<p>Paying sources for information goes against the good journalistic practice and it is inadmissible when it endangers the principle of truthfulness or when it is likely to interfere with the action of Justice. </p>
<p>Plagiarism is unacceptable. It is necessary to apply the proper professional practices when using others' work.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cite the sources and preserve the professional secrecy</strong></p>
<p>To assure the credibility of the information, the sources must be quoted. However, journalists have the moral obligation to protect them by invoking professional secrecy when necessary. Confidentiality is useful to protect people in a situation of vulnerability or risk, but in no case the anonymity can be used for unjustified attacks against individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>Good journalistic practice requires also an appropriately treatment of the information received under embargo, as well as to respect the off the record agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6. Reconcile the individual rights with the public right to know</strong></p>
<p>The journalist must defend the right to information in front of any restriction to the transparency required by the public interest, especially when the sources are government institutions and agencies. However, one must concede the individual and legal persons the right not to provide any information or to answer questions. Intimidating and persistent harassment is a reprehensible practice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Avoid conflict of interests</strong></p>
<p>The journalists should never accept payments or rewards by third parties that intend to promote, orient or get published certain information and opinions. The acceptance of promotional or commemorative gifts can never exceed the strict criteria of courtesy, according to the scale established by the journalistic organizations. It is not admissible to practise journalism simultaneously with other paid activities that endanger the principles of truthfulness and independence. </p>
<p>It is necessary to refuse formulas of promotion or advertising under the deliberate appearance of journalistic information.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the information professionals should avoid any situation of conflict of interests, whether political, commercial, economic, financial or familiar, that calls into question the credibility and impartiality of his role.</p>
<p><strong>8. Not use privileged information for one's own good</strong></p>
<p>The journalists should not use in their own benefit the information received confidentially in the exercise of their function, regardless of whether it is published or not, nor pass it on to third parties for similar reasons. They also should avoid pronouncing on companies and products in which they have some financial interest, either directly or through family members or people they know well. The same rules should apply regarding the betting and gaming industry.</p>
<p><strong>9. Respect the right to privacy</strong></p>
<p>People should be treated with respect and dignity, particularly the most vulnerable ones. Unnecessary interference and speculations about their feelings and circumstances should be avoided. Harming unjustifiably the dignity of individuals through words or pictures, even beyond their death, disobey the journalistic ethics.</p>
<p>The cases of suicide will be disclosed only when they have personal relevance or a real public interest, bearing in mind always the risk of a mimetic effect.</p>
<p><strong>10. Safeguard the presumption of innocence</strong></p>
<p>Any person accused of or charged for a crime has the right to the presumption of innocence in the information and opinions related to the investigations, lawsuits or criminal proceedings. The respect and protection of this right is valid from the beginning of the police interventions until guilt has been proved in a process celebrated with the necessary guarantees. The journalists should prevent prejudices and should not submit suspects to parallel trials.</p>
<p><strong>11. Protect the rights of minors</strong></p>
<p>Spreading the identity of minors should be avoided when they appear as victims (except in the case of murder and cases of kidnappings or disappearances), witnesses or suspects. This consideration is particularly relevant in matters of special social significance, such as sex abuse, suicides, problems related to adoptions or children of incarcerated parents. Besides, the journalists should avoid identifying against their will innocent relatives or other close people of accused or convicted persons in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>As a general rule, children should not be interviewed nor photographed or filmed without the explicit consent of their parents, legal guardians, teachers or educators. It is also not fair to allege the public relevance of relatives or close people to justify the interference in the children's private life or the exploitation of their image.</p>
<p><strong>12. Respect the dignity of the persons, as well as their physical and moral integrity</strong></p>
<p>No one can be discriminated because of gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, belief, ethnic origin, nationality and social extraction. Likewise, the journalists should avoid using degrading expressions that may incite hatred and the use of violence. The journalists need to be especially sensitive to diversity and act with a sense of justice and respect for the people and the groups affected.</p>
<h3>APPENDICES</h3>
<h4>Appendix A: Advice on image manipulation</h4>
<p>In photojournalism the pictures must be credited with author, date, place and relevant elements that identify the image, unless this could put in danger the safety of the sources. Manipulations that involve altering the visual information captured originally by the camera's lens and recorded on the storage medium are not allowed; that is to say: add, delete, move or modify any element of the original image.</p>
<p>In the field of photo-illustration the alteration of images is legitimate, without any other limit than the responsibility of the author, and with the obligation to inform, aptly, the reader of the type of alteration practiced. </p>
<h4>Appendix B: Advice about Internet</h4>
<p>The principles of journalistic ethics are common for all media and formats without any distinction. However, the characteristics of the Internet have led to an extensive casuistry that raises new ethical considerations for the professional practice.</p>
<p><strong>1. Publisher's responsibility</strong></p>
<p>The ethical regulations must rule especially the web pages that are the electronic version of existing publications in other formats, or those who, born on the web, have a header and a content that could be perceived as informative publications.</p>
<ul>
<li>These rules should also concern people who publish on-line information as individuals and can be considered journalism professionals as they receive most part of their income from this activity.</li>
<li>This appendix of good practices of information on the Internet affects also journalists who have personal blogs or participate in a professional way in social networks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Transparency and accuracy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The informative product must be recognisable as such, regardless of its formal nature. The distinction between information and opinion is also required, as well as the differentiation between advertising and information. </li>
<li>The information must be credited and the links should contain the correct references, with the purpose of guiding the recipients and keeping the data contextualized.</li>
<li>As in other media, the immediacy is no excuse to omit deontological principles as resorting to reliable sources and verifying the information.</li>
<li>The information that is been spread through social networks should not contain hearsay nor value judgements that could be offensive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Active participation and supervision</strong></p>
<p>Active audience participation enriches the plurality of media content on the Internet and is one of the most innovative defining keys of the new informative universe. However, the characteristics of the network generate new ethical traps on the relationship between the media and the public.</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback from users to the news disclosed on informative websites should be moderated by responsible publishers. These should count with mechanisms and appropriate tools to prevent the dissemination of offensive messages which could violate the dignity of the people and social groups or stimulate discrimination, violence and hatred.</li>
<li>The contributions on the Internet should not be anonymous. The diffuser should require a prior registration for users who wish to comment and give their opinions, in the same way that newspapers don't publish letters to the editor written by people who have not been properly identified. Anonymity is admissible when it tries to ensure information on facts and opinions of unequivocal public interest or vital need, but the participant must be equally identified in front of the medium.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Continuance of documents on-line</strong></p>
<p>The indefinite continuance on the web of documents and audiovisual materials could produce undesirable or uncomfortable situations for the people affected, either if they are information sources or witnesses. In the case that they ask for erasure of the data, the requirement should reconcile the public interest with the individual rights. In any case, the invocation of the right to oblivion should not be reason for the immediate destruction of items that in some ways are part of a general archive or living memory which is a collective heritage and eventually may be of interest to historians and social researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a general rule, the claim for destruction of online-traces on behalf of individuals or legal entities should not be accepted obligatory when they allege simple reasons as a change of opinion or image, or other strictly personal considerations.</li>
<li>However, the persistence of certain documents should not generate abusive or harmful situations at the expense of the fundamental rights of the person.</li>
<li>Consequently, the responsible publishers should prevent or palliate the possible damages caused to people who have given their testimony (image, voice or documentation), due to the singular fact of the continuity, the ease of access and the reproduction and manipulation of the materials present on the internet. This attitude must be especially prudent when the affected are children or young people in a situation of defencelessness or risk against the possible use of their presence on the Internet.</li>
<li>In any case, the very nature of the web as a global and permanent stock with all kind of contents of universal access makes it practically unfeasible to remove discretionarily, systematically, instantly and extensively materials considered improper or harmful to individuals, companies or institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Authorship and plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>The recognition of intellectual authorship and all kinds of derived rights must be respected on the Internet in the same way as on any other informative format. The ease of copy and paste provided by those digital products, becoming a daily written and mechanical practice, should never be a pretext for plagiarism and usurpation.</p>
<h4>Appendix C: Advice on plagiarism</h4>
<p>The criterion 1 of the Code urges to check all the information, while the criterion 5 recommends, as a general rule, to quote the sources. These performance standards are the basis of the credibility of journalists, and their meticulous compliance depends greatly on the confidence of the public.
Plagiarism means the reproduction without any credits of a significant part of somebody else's work.Doing so may constitute a crime, but it can also severely undermine the credibility of a journalist or a news medium. There are various forms of plagiarism, all of them detestable, although with different degrees of severity:</p>
<ul>
<li>the literal reproduction of an extract of a literary work, a journalistic work or any other document of which the authorship is identifiable and provable.</li>
<li>the reproduction of photographs or images of any kind that have authorship, even though if they are not subjected to copyright.</li>
<li>the reuse of extracts of interviews or recordings that were obtained by journalists from other media and that could have been copied from broadcasts of someone else. Although the reproduction is not literal, disseminating information without quoting the other medium that obtained and spread it first can also be judged as plagiarism. The citation is particularly required in the case of a scoop or highly relevant information that other media obtained from sources that were only available to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the credits of the origin of the information are well expressed or when it has been obtained directly from the same source or multiple sources, it cannot be considered as plagiarism.</p>
<h4>Appendix D: Advice on treatment of war and armed conflicts</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give voice to all actors and promote the understanding between the parties involved. Dialogue must be encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not dehumanize one of the parts; it is necessary to report about the victims as well as the attackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid the language of the warring factions and their allies. Expose the machination of any of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show the groups that work for peace at the basis, not just the leaders; especially, the efforts of the civil society, which cares physically, materially and emotionally for the victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore the conflicts in all their complexities and deal with the violence and its visible and invisible effects, but also deal with the causes that generated the conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid sensationalism and prevent the uncontrolled emission of warlike, xenophobic, racist and sexist online-messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report on a conflict even if there is no violence, because that can help to prevent it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not abandon the coverage after the cease-of-fire and deal with the resolution, reconstruction and reconciliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take advantage of the similarities between the conflicts, because the constructive experiences will benefit those who have not yet found a way to resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quote always the information sources, particularly when they represent confronted factions, and bear
in mind that third sources enhance the view of the conflict. In case that the information is made under censorship or with restrictions, it must be made clear to the recipients.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Appendix E: Advice on the use of the term 'illegal' referred to people</h4>
<p>The term illegal applied to immigrants is wrong and violates the criteria of the Code of Ethics of the journalistic profession, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>People can never be illegal because this would deny to a human being the category of subject of law.</li>
<li>The inappropriate application of this word implies contempt of the dignity and self-image of these people.</li>
<li>The use of this word to designate, exclusively and continuously, the collective of workers who migrate
means a discriminatory treatment and promotes stereotypes that criminalize the image of these people in the collective consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Appendix F: Advice on citation of nationalities and ethnic groups</h4>
<p>The use by audiovisual media of words and concepts related to the nationality or the origin to designate in headlines an individual or a group of individuals that have committed criminal acts is discriminatory. When the information treatment given by the media enters a discriminatory context with the purpose of drawing the attention of the reader, that causes a negative attitude of the citizens towards migration and immigrants.</p>
<p>The CIC recommends the media to act with special responsibility and exactitude in the case of information or opinions with contents that could provoke discrimination for reasons of gender, ethnicity, belief or social or cultural background; they should avoid in any case the generalizations and the labelling of people because of differential features, whether ethnic, religious, economic or social. Anyway, if the medium believes that the nationality of the protagonists is relevant information, and without encouraging discriminatory ideas at the receiver, the CIC recommends mentioning it always, wherever the actors of the reported facts come from.</p>

"18_ES";"Spain";"ES";"Code of Ethics";"<h1>Code of Ethics</h1>
<p><em>(Approved at the Ordinary Assembly held in Seville on 27 November 1993 and updated in the Ordinary Assembly held in Merida on April 22, 2017)</em></p>
<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the civil liberties enshrined in the Constitution, constituting the necessary reference for a fully democratic society, the profession of journalism represents an important social commitment, to make the free and effective development of fundamental rights over the freedom of information and expression of ideas a reality for all citizens.</p>
<p>As their subject and instrument of freedom of expression, journalists recognize and guarantee that their profession is the avenue for expressing free public opinion within the pluralism of a democratic and social constitutional State.</p>
<p>However, journalists also consider that whilst their profession allows them the use and enjoyment of their constitutional rights to freedom of expression and the right to information, this is subject to limits that prevent the infringement of other fundamental rights. These rules for professional behaviour must also be put into practice in the exercise of journalism whatever technological medium is used.</p>
<p>For this reason, in taking on these commitments, and as a true guarantee offered to Spanish society, which it serves, the journalistic profession understands that it is incumbent upon it to maintain, collectively and individually, responsible behaviour as regards the ethics and rules of professional conduct relating to information. Journalists, members of the Federation of Press Associations of Spain, make a commitment to society to maintain their own specific ethics and rules of professional conduct in the exercise of their profession.</p>
<p>By virtue of which, the General Assembly of the Federation of Press Associations of Spain (*) promulgates the following ethical principles and rules of the journalistic profession:</p>
<h3>I – GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>
<p>1. The journalist shall always act in keeping with the principles of professionalism and ethics contained in this Code of Ethics, whose express acceptance shall be a necessary condition for inclusion in the Professional Register of Journalists and the Federation of Press Associations.</p>
<p>Those who, subsequent to their inclusion in the Register and the corresponding Association, act in a manner not compatible with these principles, shall fall under the circumstances contemplated in the corresponding legislation.</p>
<p>2. The journalist's first ethical commitment is respect for the truth.</p>
<p>3. In accordance with this obligation, the journalist shall at all times defend the principle of freedom to investigate and circulate information and the freedom of comment and criticism.</p>
<p>4. Without prejudice to protecting the right of citizens to be informed, the journalist shall respect the right of persons to their own privacy and image, bearing in mind that:</p>
<p>a) Defence of the public interest alone justifies intrusion or inquiry into a person's private life without his or her prior consent.</p>
<p>b) In general, expressions, images or testimonies which are humiliating or damaging to the personal status of individuals and their physical or moral integrity should be avoided.</p>
<p>c) In news coverage of matters involving aspects of pain or distress for the persons concerned, the journalist shall avoid gratuitous intrusion and unnecessary speculation about their feelings and circumstances.</p>
<p>d) Restrictions on the invasion of privacy shall be observed with particular care if people have been admitted to hospitals or similar institutions.</p>
<p>e) Special attention shall be paid to the coverage of matters affecting children and young people and the right to privacy of minors shall be respected.</p>
<p>5. The journalist must embrace the principle that every person is innocent until proven otherwise and avoid as far as possible any harmful consequences resulting from the fulfilment of his or her journalistic duties. Such criteria are particularly enforceable if the information deals with matters submitted to the Courts of Law.</p>
<p>a) The journalist shall avoid naming in his reports the relatives and friends of persons accused or convicted of a crime, unless such mention is necessary for the news to be complete or fair.</p>
<p>b) The naming of victims of an offense, as well as the publication of material that may contribute to their identification shall be avoided, acting with special diligence in the case of crimes against sexual freedom.</p>
<p>6. The criteria indicated in the above two principles shall be applied with extreme rigour when the coverage may affect minors. In particular, the journalist shall refrain from interviewing, photographing or recording minors with regard to matters relating to criminal activities or those which can be considered to fall within the field of privacy.</p>
<p>7. Journalists shall exercise their professional zeal in respect of the rights of the weakest and those discriminated against. Therefore, they shall exercise special sensitivity in cases of news or opinions of potentially discriminatory content or likely to incite violence or degrading human practices.</p>
<p>a) Journalists must therefore refrain from alluding, in a derogatory manner or with prejudice, to the race, colour, religion, social background or sex of a person or any physical or mental illness or disability suffered.</p>
<p>b) Journalists must also refrain from publishing such details, unless they are directly related to the information published.</p>
<h3>II – STATUTE</h3>
<p>1. In order to ensure the necessary independence and equity in the performance of their profession, journalists must claim, for themselves and for those who work under their orders:</p>
<p>a) The right to decent working conditions, both in terms of remuneration and the material and professional circumstances in which they must carry out their task.</p>
<p>b) The duty and right to oppose any obvious attempt at media monopoly or oligopoly, which may impede social and political pluralism.</p>
<p>c) The duty and right to participate in the journalistic enterprise, so that their freedom of information is guaranteed in a manner compatible with the rights of the media in which the news is expressed.</p>
<p>d) The right to invoke the conscience clause, if the media on which they rely claims a moral attitude that damages their professional dignity or substantively alters the editorial stance.</p>
<p>e) The right and obligation to be provided with up-to-date and complete professional training.</p>
<p>2. Journalists are entitled to be protected both within the framework of their own company and by associations or institutional organisations, against those who, by applying pressure of any kind, attempt to divert them from the sphere of action set out in this Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>3. Professional secrecy is a journalist's right, as well as a duty that guarantees the confidentiality of information sources. Consequently, journalists shall guarantee the right of their information sources to remain anonymous, if so requested. However, such a professional duty may be surrendered as an exception in the event that it is reliably stated that the source has knowingly misrepresented information or when disclosure of the source is the only means to avoid serious and immediate harm to persons.</p>
<p>4. It is the responsibility of journalists to monitor scrupulously fulfilment by the Public Authorities of their obligation of transparency of information. In particular, they shall always defend free access to information from, or generated by, these Authorities, in their Archives or Administrative Records.</p>
<p>5. Journalists shall respect and enforce the copyright and intellectual property rights deriving from all kinds of creative activity. They shall avoid all forms of plagiarism and shall pay particular attention to ensuring that the reproduction of content via technological means does not infringe the rights mentioned.</p>
<h3>III – PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES</h3>
<p>1. The commitment to the search for truth shall always lead journalists to report only on facts of whose origin they are certain, without falsifying documents or omitting essential information, and not to publish false, misleading or distorted coverage. Accordingly:</p>
<p>a) They must substantiate the information they circulate, including the duty to compare sources and to give the person concerned the opportunity to offer his or her own version of the facts.</p>
<p>b) Having been alerted to the dissemination of false, misleading or distorted material, journalists shall be obliged to correct the error suffered as quickly as possible employing the same typographical and/or audiovisual format as that used to circulate it. They shall also send an apology via the medium they use where appropriate.</p>
<p>c) In addition, without the need for the persons concerned to go to court, the journalist shall provide natural or legal persons with the appropriate opportunity to counter inaccuracies in a manner similar to that indicated in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>2. In the performance of their professional duties, journalists shall use justifiable methods to obtain news, which excludes unlawful procedures.</p>
<p>3. Journalists shall recognize and respect the right of natural and legal persons not to provide information, or answer questions they are asked, without prejudice to their professional duty to address the rights of citizens to information.</p>
<p>4. With the same exceptions provided for professional secrecy, the journalist shall respect the off the record rule if it has been expressly invoked or it is concluded that such was the will of the informant.</p>
<p>5. Journalists shall always make a clear and unequivocal distinction between the facts they recount and what may be opinions, interpretations or conjecture, although in the exercise of their professional activity they are not obliged to be neutral.</p>
<p>6. In order not to mislead or confuse users, the journalist is obliged to make a formal and rigorous distinction between information and publicity.</p>
<p>Providing news coverage at the same time as publicity or institutional or private social communication activities is understood to be contrary to the ethics of the journalistic profession when they affect the rules and principles of journalistic ethics.</p>
<p>7. The journalist shall not accept, directly or indirectly, remuneration or gratuities from third parties, for promoting, advising, influencing or having published information or opinions of any kind.</p>
<p>8. Journalists shall never use the privileged information they have learned as a result of their professional practice for their own benefit. In particular, journalists who are routinely or occasionally informed about financial matters shall be subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<p>a) They may not use for their own monetary gain financial data that come to their knowledge prior to its general dissemination, nor may they communicate such data to third parties.</p>
<p>b) They may not write about shares or securities in which they themselves or their family members have a significant financial interest.</p>
<p>c) They may not in any way negotiate shares or securities which they intend to write about in the near future.</p>
<p>9. The principles and standards contained in this Code of Ethics shall also apply in cases where journalists make use of digital or other technological communication or information systems in any format.</p>

### Guidelines operative from 1 January 2014

Freedom of speech is the foundation of a democratic society. Good journalistic practice is based on the public's right to have access to facts and opinions.

The aim of these guidelines is to support the responsible use of freedom of speech in mass communication and encourage discourse on professional ethics.

These guidelines concern all journalistic work. They have been drafted specifically for the purpose of self-regulation. The guidelines are not intended to be used as grounds for criminal liability or damages.


### PROFESSIONAL STATUS

1. A journalist is primarily responsible to the readers, listeners and viewers, who have the right to know what is happening in society.
2. Decisions concerning the content of media must be made in accordance with journalistic principles. The power to make such decisions must not under any circumstances be surrendered to any party outside the editorial office.
3. The journalist has the right and obligation to resist pressure or persuasion that attempts to steer, prevent or limit communications.
4. The journalist must not misuse his/her position. The journalist may not deal with issues that may lead to potential personal gain nor demand or receive benefits that might compromise his/her personal independence or professional ethics.
5. The journalist is entitled to refuse assignments that conflict with the law, his/her personal convictions or good journalistic practice.
6. When handling issues that concern the journalist's own media, the media concern or its owners, the journalist should make the context of the news item clear to readers, listeners and viewers.
7. It is crucial to observe good professional practice when using the work of others. Sources must be mentioned when information has been published by other parties.
  

### OBTAINING AND PUBLISHING INFORMATION

8. The journalist must aim to provide truthful information.
9. The journalist is encouraged to make known his/her profession during the course of an assignment. Information should be obtained openly. If matters that are in the public interest cannot be otherwise investigated, the journalist may carry out interviews and obtain information by means that depart from standard practice.
10. Information obtained must be checked as thoroughly as possible, including when it has been published previously.
11. The public must be able to distinguish facts from opinions and fictitious material. Similarly, photographic and sound material must not be used in a misleading manner.
12. Information sources must be approached critically. This is particularly important in controversial issues, since the source of the information may be intended for personal gain or to damage others.
13. A news item may be published on the basis of limited information. Reports on subjects and events should be supplemented once new information becomes available. News events should be pursued to the end.
14. The journalist is entitled and duty bound to conceal the identity of any person who has provided confidential information by agreement with the source. If the publication of information that is in the public interest results in highly negative publicity, it is desirable that the editorial office makes public how the reliability of the anonymous source and the information obtained from it has been assured.
15. Headlines, leads, cover and picture captions, sales-promotion posters and other presentation material must be justified by the substance of the story.
16. There must be a clear demarcation kept between advertising and editorial content. Hidden advertising must be avoided.
  

### THE RIGHTS OF INTERVIEWER AND INTERVIEWEE

17. Interviewees have the right to know in advance the context in which their statements will be used. They must also be told if the interview will be used in multiple mediums. The interviewee must always be told whether the conversation is intended for publication or will be used exclusively as background material.
18. It is worthwhile consenting to interviewee's requests to read their statements prior to publication, if the editorial deadline permits. This right only concerns the personal statements of the interviewee, and the final journalistic decision cannot be surrendered to any party outside the editorial office.
19. The interviewee's refusal to allow the publishing of his/her statement must be complied with only if the circumstances following the interview have changed so significantly that the publication of the interview could be viewed as unjust.
  

### CORRECTIONS AND RIGHT OF REPLY

20. Essentially incorrect information must be corrected without delay and so as to reach, to the highest extent possible, the attention of those who have had access to the incorrect information. The correction must be publicised on the editorial website of the media in question, as well as in the publication or broadcast in which the incorrect information was originally given.

The degree of attention brought to the correction must correspond to the seriousness of the error. If there are multiple factual errors in an article, or if the incorrect information might result in significant damage, the editors must publish a new article in which the incorrect information is identified and corrected.

In terms of the correction of essential information in the Internet, it is not enough that the incorrect information or article is removed, the public must also be told about the error, as well as how and when the correction was made.

It is advisable that the media in question make clear to the public those practices and principles by which they correct their own errors.

21. If the intention is to present information about the activities of a clearly identifiable person, company or organisation in a manner that would present them in a very negative light, the object of the criticism must be granted the right of reply on the issue in question.

22. If it is not possible to simultaneously hear the views of the parties involved, it may be necessary to give the party who has received the very negative publicity the opportunity to be heard afterwards. If this is not done, good journalistic practice calls for the publication of the comment of the criticised party.

23. A right of reply is an intervention that should be published as soon as possible without any irrelevant additions.

24. Conventional cultural critique, political, economic or societal evaluation or similar expression of opinion do not, however, warrant a right to reply.

25. If the reply is not fit for publication as such, changes should be discussed with the writer. Even if an agreement cannot be reached, it is advisable to publish the essential contents in an objective manner.
  

### PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

26. The human dignity of every individual must be respected. The ethnic origin, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, convictions or other similar personal characteristics may not be presented in an inappropriate or disparaging manner.
27. Highly delicate matters concerning people's personal lives may only be published with the consent of the person in question, or if such matters are of considerable public interest. Protection of privacy must also be considered when using photographic materials.
28. Discretion must always be exercised when reporting on occurrences of illnesses or deaths or on victims of accidents or crimes.
29. It is generally acceptable to cover and photograph any event that happens in a public place without having to obtain permission from the subject(s) in question.
30. The right to privacy also applies when publishing public documents or other public sources. The public availability of information does not necessarily imply that it can be freely published. Particular discretion should be used when an issue concerns minors.
31. The name, photograph or other identifying facts of a person convicted of a crime may be published, unless it is viewed as clearly excessive in terms of the position or action of that individual. The journalist must be particularly careful not to disclose the identity of a minor or person found to be criminally unaccountable.
32. Carefulness is required when presenting information that may lead to the identification of the subject in cases where the subject is only considered a suspect or has been charged.
33. Information about the convicted, charged or suspected individual should not be published if it may reveal the identity of the victim of a highly sensitive crime.
34. The identity of a victim of a highly sensitive crime must be protected, unless the matter is of considerable public interest.
35. If the request for investigation, indictments or conviction has been a published news item, the matter should be followed to the end as is possible. During an ongoing trial, the journalist will not strive to affect the decisions of the court or present a premature position on the guilt of the subject in question.

*Adopted at the meeting of the CMM Management Group, November 4 2013, operative from 1 January 2014.*



### Annex to Guidelines: Material generated by the public on a media website

### Operative from 1 October 2011

This Annex has been prepared as a supplement to the Guidelines for Journalists. The importance and binding nature of the Annex are the same as for the Guidelines. The Annex is binding on all members of the Council for Mass Media's associations and other signatories of the Basic Agreement. The Annex and changes made to it are, as with the Guidelines, affirmed unanimously by the CMM's Management Group.

The specificity of the Annex is intended to highlight its separation from the Guidelines for Journalists, relating to editorial content. This concerns material that its editorially prepared, ordered, processed and selected for publication on journalistic principles or with journalistic emphasis. The Annex concerns content generated by the public on websites maintained by the media. This should not be regarded as editorial material.

The Council and the chairperson may deal with the activity of an editorial office in administering online forums containing material generated by the public only from the point of view whether the editorial office has complied with the principles of this Annex. The principles of the Annex in applying to the prior and subsequent moderation of public online forums are dealt with equally.

The approach of the Annex has been taken for reasons of expediency. The Guidelines for Journalists have been revised at intervals of 6-13 years. The online environment is changing and developing extremely quickly. Due to its specificity, the Annex can be altered without amending the Guidelines. 

1. The editorial office shall monitor their websites and try to prevent the publication of content that violates privacy and human dignity. In addition to discrimination, the violation of human dignity includes for example content that incites violence and stirs up hatred towards an individual or group.
2. The editorial office shall promptly delete content that comes to its attention that violates privacy and human dignity.
3. Online forums directed at children and the young must be monitored particularly carefully.
4. The public must be given the opportunity to inform editorial offices of inappropriate content in such a way that the informant receives due confirmation.
5. A clear demarcation must be kept on media websites between forums reserved for the public and editorial content.

*Adopted by the meeting of the CMM Management Group 5 September 2011.*

*The Annex comes into effect on 1 October 2011, with the exception of point 4, which comes into effect no later than 1 December 2011.*

"21_FR";"France";"FR";"Journalists' professional Code of Ethics";" # Journalists' professional Code of Ethics

**SNJ, 1918/38/2011**

This relates to the latest version of the Code of Ethics, the foundation stone of the profession, adopted by the National Committee in March 2011 for the 93rd anniversary of the SNJ (French National Union of Journalists).

The public right to high-quality, complete, free, independent and pluralistic information of which we are reminded in the Declaration of Human Rights and the French Constitution, guides journalists in the performance of their jobs. This responsibility to the citizen takes precedence over any other.

These principles and the ethical rules set out below are binding on every journalist, whatever their job, responsibility within the editorial chain or the form of press in which they work.

The responsibility of a journalist cannot, however, be confused with that of an editor, nor exempt the latter from his own obligations.

The activity of journalism consists of researching, verifying, putting in context, prioritising, shaping, commentating on and publishing high-quality information; it must not be confused with communication. Journalism demands time and resources, whatever the medium. It is not possible for ethical rules to be observed without implementation of the conditions that this requires.

The concept of urgency in the dissemination of information, or of exclusivity, must not take away from the serious nature of the enquiry and the verification of sources.

Physical and moral security is the basis for journalistic independence. It must be guaranteed, whatever the contract of employment with the company.

Working in a freelance capacity must benefit from the same guarantees as those which salaried journalists enjoy.

No journalist must be forced to carry out an action or express an opinion contrary to his own convictions or professional conscience, nor to the principles and rules of this charter.

A journalist must accomplish all the activities of his profession (enquiry, investigations, taking photos and recording sounds etc.) freely, have access to all sources of information with regard to the facts which condition public life, and have the guarantee that his sources' confidentiality will be protected.

It is under these conditions that a journalist worthy of the name:

- Takes responsibility for all his professional productions, even if anonymous;
- Respects people's dignity and the presumption of innocence;
- Upholds critical thinking, veracity, accuracy, integrity, fairness and impartiality as the pillars of journalistic activity; considers accusation without evidence, intention to harm, alteration of documents, distortion of the facts, misuse of images, lies, manipulation, censorship and self-censorship or failure to verify the facts as constituting the most serious professional abuses;
- Exercises the greatest vigilance before disseminating information, from wherever it originates;
- Has author copyright, which is also a duty, on information which he disseminates, and strives to rectify as soon as possible any information disseminated which proves to be inaccurate; 
- In matters of ethical conduct and professional honour, accepts only the judgment of his peers; answers to the courts for crimes defined by law;
- Defends freedom of expression, opinion, information, commentary and criticism;
- Outlaws any unfair or corrupt method of obtaining information. In the event that his own safety, that of his sources or the seriousness of the facts obliges him to conceal his role as a journalist, he must inform his line management accordingly and provide the public with an explanation as soon as possible;
- Does not accept money from a public service, institution or private company in which his role as a journalist, his influence or his relationships may be exploited;
- Does not use the freedom of the press with the intention of serving his own interests;
- Refuses and combats as contrary to his professional ethics any confusion between journalism and communication;
- Names fellow workers whose work he uses, does not commit plagiarism;
- Does not solicit a fellow worker job by offering to work under inferior conditions;
- Maintains professional confidentiality and protects the sources of his information;
- Does not confuse his role with that of policeman or judge.

Declaration of the rights of man and of citizens (article XI): 'Free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious rights of Man: any Citizen may therefore speak, write and print freely, subject to responsibility for the abuse of this freedom in the cases determined by Law.'

Constitution of France (article 34): 'The Law fixes the rules on civic rights and fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of public freedoms; the freedom, pluralism and independence of the media.'

Declaration of the rights and duties of journalists (Munich, 1971): the SNJ, which was behind the initiative to create the International Federation of Journalists in Paris in 1926, is also one of the inspirations behind this Declaration which brings together all unions of journalists at European level."
"22_FR";"France";"FR";"Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Journalists";" # Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Journalists

The right to information, to freedom of expression and criticism is one of the fundamental rights of man. All rights and duties of a journalist originate from this right of the public to be informed on events and opinions. The journalist's responsibility towards the public excels any other responsibility, particularly towards employers and public authorities. The mission of information necessarily includes restrictions which journalists spontaneously impose on themselves. This is the object of the declaration of duties formulated below. A journalist however, can respect these duties while exercising his profession only if conditions of independence and professional dignity effectively exist. This is the object of the following declaration of rights.

### Declaration of duties

The essential obligations of a journalist engaged in gathering, editing and commenting news are :

1. To respect truth whatever be the consequence to himself, because of the right of the public to know the truth;
2. To defend freedom of information, comment and criticism;
3. To report only on facts of which he knows the origin; not to suppress essential information nor alter texts and documents;
4. Not to use unfair methods to obtain news, photographs or documents;
5. To restrict himself to the respect of privacy;
6. To rectify any published information which is found to be inaccurate;
7. To observe professional secrecy and not to divulge the source of information obtained in confidence;
8. To regard as grave professional offenses the following: plagiarism, calumny, slander, libel and unfounded accusations, the acceptance of bribe in any form in consideration of either publication or suppression of news;
9. Never to confuse the profession of a journalist with that of advertisements salesman or a propagandist and to refuse any direct or indirect orders from advertisers.
10. To resist every pressure and to accept editorial orders only from the responsible persons of the editorial staff.

Every journalist worthy of that name deems it his duty faithfully to observe the principles stated above. Within the general law of each country, the journalist recognises, in professional matters, the jurisdiction of his colleagues only; he excludes every kind of interference by governments or others.

### Declaration of rights

1. Journalists claim free access to all information sources, and the right to freely inquire on all events conditioning public life. Therefore, secret of public or private affairs may be opposed only to journalists in exceptional cases and for clearly expressed motives;
2. The journalist has the right to refuse subordination to anything contrary to the general policy of the information organ to which he collaborates such as it has been laid down by writing and incorporated in his contract of employment, as well as any subordination not clearly implicated by this general policy;
3. A journalist cannot be compelled to perform a professional act or to express an opinion contrary to his convictions or his conscience;
4. The editorial staff has obligatorily to be informed on all important decisions which may influence the life of the enterprise. It should at least be consulted before a definitive decision on all matters related to the composition of the editorial staff, e.g. recruitment, dismissals, mutations and promotion of journalists is taken.
5. Taking in account his functions and responsibilities, the journalist is entitled not only to the advantages resulting from collective agreements but also to an individual contract of employment, ensuring the material and moral security of his work as well as a wage system corresponding to his social condition and guaranteeing his economic independence."

<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The Code of Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility of journalists-members of the Journalists Unions aims to:</p>

<li>Ensure freedom of information and expression, the autonomy and dignity of the journalist and defend the freedom of the press for the benefit of democracy and society;
To this end, journalists commit themselves to applying and defending the following fundamental principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article 1:</strong></p>
<p>The right of people and citizens to inform and be freely informed is inalienable. Information is a public good and not a commodity or a means of propaganda. Journalists are entitled and must:</p>

Redress without delay, with appropriate presentation and suitable emphasis, inaccurate information and false allegations which are an affront to the honour and reputation of citizens and people, and print or present the opposite view without, necessarily, a rejoinder that would place such journalist in a privileged position vis-à-vis the injured party.</p>

<p>Journalism as a profession, but also as a social service, entails rights, duties and obligations. Journalists are entitled and must:</p>
<p>a. Treat citizens equally, without making any discrimination as to national origin, sex, race, religion, political beliefs, economic situation and social status;</p>

<p><strong>Article 4:</strong></p>

<p>a. Support and underpin the activities of their trade union organisation aimed at improving remuneration and employment conditions in the mass media;</p>

<p>Transparency in financial relationships constitutes a fundamental element of the credibility, prestige and professional dignity of journalists who must:</p>
<p>a. Neither pursue nor accept payment for journalistic work from secret funds of state agencies and public or private organisations funds;</p>
<p>b. Neither pursue nor accept any sinecure or remunerated position related to their specialty in press office, public agencies or private enterprises which may cast doubt on their professional autonomy and independence;</p>
<p>c. Neither pursue nor accept the promotional use of their name, voice or image, except for public benefit purposes;</p>
<p>d. Neither report nor exploit for own benefit exclusive information which influences the course of stock exchange prices and the market;</p>
<p>e. To neither pursue nor accept any monetary benefits and benefits in kind which compromises their credibility and dignity and influences their independence and impartiality.</p>

<p>a. Contribute to the enhancement of journalistic discourse, avoiding grammatical, syntactic and semantic blatant errors;</p>
<p>b. Avoid vulgarisms, vulgarity and linguistic barbarity, observing, even in satire and caricature, the standards of professional ethics and social responsibility;</p>

### GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The right to accurate, complete and timely information and freedom of thought and expression are one of the fundamental rights and freedoms of every human being, regardless of race, color, gender, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, posessions, birth, education, social status or other characteristics. This right of the public to be informed of the facts and opinions also implies the entirety of the obligations and rights of journalists. In their work, journalists have a duty to defend human rights, dignity, freedoms and values, respect the pluralism of ideas and views, resist all forms of censorship, contribute to strengthening the rule of law and participate, as part of the public, in democratic control of power and government. Journalists adhere to the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Croatia, nurture the culture and ethics of public expression and respect civilizational achievements and values. It is their obligation to adhere to professional ethical principles. This Code establishes these principles and protects the inalienable rights of individuals and the right of the public to information.

### JOURNALISM AS A CALLING

1. In their activities, journalists are guided by the ethics of journalism as a calling. They safeguard the reputation, dignity and integrity of their profession, cooperate with each other and foster collegial relationships and professional solidarity.

2. Starting from the principle that in a democratic society the public media are free, independent, investigative and open to different and diverse opinions, the journalist bears responsibility for his/her work before the public, the law and his/her professional organization. By presenting his/her own and critical viewpoint in the search for truth, as a basic principle in professional work, the journalist actively participates in the creation of public opinion and collective reflection on topics of public interest.

3. A journalist has the right and the duty to refuse a work assignment that is contrary to the professional ethical standards of the journalistic work.

4. The work of journalists is subject to public criticism. Journalists and editorial staff are obliged to treat carefully and critically all comments and recommendations made to them.


### INFORMATION FLOW 

5. It is the right and duty of journalists to advocate the free information flow. The journalist is obliged to present accurate, complete and verified information. He/she critically judges the sources of information and, as per rule, cites them. He/she has the right not to disclose the source of the information, but is responsible for the published information.

6. In all journalistic contributions, including comments and polemics, the journalist is obliged to respect the ethics of public speech and the culture of dialogue and to respect the honor, reputation and dignity of the persons or groups with whom he or she enters into a discussion. When reporting on topics on which various relevant positions are present, and in particular when allegations are made, the journalist seeks to make all those views available to the public.

7. A journalist has the right to investigate freely all facts of public interest as well as the right of access to all related sources of information. If he/she is unjustifiably denied the requested information which is of public interest, he/she shall have the right to inform the public of such events. Paying to obtain information and cooperating with a source expecting payment, or any other favours in exchange for information, is only permissible if it is the only way of obtaining information of exceptional public interest.

8. A journalist must not abuse the trust established with the source of information. The legal person or natural person providing the information to the journalist must be informed by the journalist in what medium and in what context will this information be published. The meaning of statements and interviews should not be distorted by the journalist, either directly or by taking them out of context. Authorization only means the authentication of the content of the interview. Interview equipment is not subject to authorization. Once authorized, the interview is considered final.

9. When collecting information, a journalist may not use methods contrary to this Code unless there is no other way to obtain information of extreme public interest. Attempts to extort information through intimidation, threats, blackmail and other forms of coercion are unacceptable.

10. The journalist respects the legal provisions on confidentiality of information and the embargo on the publication of information. Breach of these restrictions is permissible only if they have been misused to prevent the publication of information of extreme public interest.

11. The journalist respects the authorship of other journalists and other participants in the public informing systems. In its appendices it lists the sources he/she used. Plagiarism is incompatible with journalistic ethics.

12. If the journalist has published inaccurate information, he/she is obliged to correct it as soon as possible. The correction should be published in the same or equivalent location of the media space and in the same or equivalent manner as the information to which the correction relates. The same applies to any other proceedings that violate the principles of this Code.

### FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS 

13. In their activities, journalists respect, protect and promote fundamental human rights and freedoms, and in particular the principle of equality for all citizens. Special responsibility is expected when reporting or commenting on the rights, needs, problems and demands of minority social groups. Information about race, colour, religion or nationality, ae, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, any physical or mental personality or illness, marital status, lifestyle, social status, property status or educational level, is provided by a journalist only if is highly relevant in the context in which it is presented. It is inadmissible to use stereotypes, pejorative expressions, degrading portrayal, as well as any other form of direct or indirect incitement or support for discrimination. 

14. A journalist should protect a person's intimacy from sensationalistic disclosure and any other unjustified disclosure to the public. He/she is bound to respect everyone's right to privacy. It is unacceptable to shoot or photograph people without their permission, in an environment where privacy is reasonably expected. Violation of one's privacy beyond one's will and knowledge is permissible only if justified by an exceptional public interest.

15. Particular attention, caution and accountability are required when reporting suicides, accidents, personal tragedies, illnesses, deaths and acts of violence. A journalist should avoid interviewing and portraying persons who are directly or indirectly affected by these events, except in the case of extreme public interest. In this case, the journalist is obliged to take into account the honor, reputation and dignity of the persons he/she reports about.

16. News of suicides and suicide attempts is not to be emphasized and should be kept to a minimum, with particular regard to children. The professional guidelines for suicide reporting need to be adhered to.

17. The reports and articles on court proceedings should respect the constitutional principle of the presumption of innocence of the accused and the dignity, integrity and feelings of all parties in the dispute. In criminal proceedings, journalists are obliged to respect the right to the protection of the identity of protected witnesses, confidants, whistleblowers and harmed parties. Their identity may not be disclosed without their consent, except in cases of extreme public interest.

18. In dealing with political conflicts, the journalist respects the civil rights and freedoms of the participants and the basis of the democratic political system. In doing so, he/she seeks to maintain adequate professional distance.

19. A journalist must not interview or photograph a child (up to 14 years old) without his or her consent and without the presence and consent of the parent or other adult responsible for the child. Even if such consent exists, it is inadmissible to interview or photograph a child if that could jeopardize his or her well-being. The same applies to any other procedure which directly or indirectly reveals the identity of a child. The welfare of the child is superior to the public interest.

20. A journalist may not disclose the identity of a child or a minor involved in sexual abuse or any other form of violence or crime, whether the child or minor is a witness, victim, suspect or defendant. Media coverage of such cases should not allow the identification of a child or a minor. The identity of a child or minor may only be disclosed exceptionally when it is in the public interest and does not jeopardize the welfare of the child or minor, and with the consent of the parent or guardian of the child or minor, or when required for the welfare of the child by government bodies.

### INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGEMENT 

21. A journalist must not engage in activities that might jeopardize his independence, objectivity and independence of judgment, afflicting his journalistic dignity. He/she must avoid situations that could lead him/her into a conflict of interest and threaten his/her personal and journalistic profession. The journalist does not accept gifts, services, awards, paid trips, additional employment, work in politics and other benefits that may diminish or call into question his or her credibility as well as the credibility of the journalistic profession. All other situations that may give the impression of his/hers bias should also be avoided. If he/she finds himself/herself in a conflict of interest, he/she must disclose it to the public. The journalist is obliged to resist all forms of pressure by individuals or groups to influence his/her reporting and has the right to inform the public about such attempts.

22. A journalist, like any citizen, has the right to political and other choices. However, in his/her work, he/she takes a professional distance from current events, which is one of the preconditions for objective and professional event reporting.

23. A journalist must not publish information for personal gain. Until the public has been informed of them, the journalist must not use information on financial developments obtained through his/her journalistic activities, for personal interests. If he/she trades with bonds, stocks or similar valuable papers that he/she also reports about, it must be disclosed to the public.

24. A journalist must not be the author of advertisements and other propaganda material, as this calls into question his professional impartiality. The same goes for every other form of participation in advertising and propaganda activities.

### EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

25. Editors of newspapers, radio and television programs, as well as electronic publications that publish journalistic articles, are required to abide the professional ethical principles applicable to all journalists. It is their responsibility to ensure that the advertisements, letters of the readers, as well as all other non-journalistic textual, visual and audio content of the editorial issues comply with the ethical and legal principles of public communication. In electronic publications, where users directly publish textual, visual or audio content, editors are required to provide mechanisms that will prevent or at least restrict the publication of ethically and legally unacceptable content. If they are published, they are obliged to remove them from the issue as soon as possible.

26. An editor must not ask a journalist to work against professional ethical principles.

27. Journalistic articles with substantially altered meaning by shortening or other editorial interventions may be published only with the consent of the author. If there is a disagreement, the author has the right to withdraw his contribution or signature. The editorial board is responsible for a journalistic article published without the author's name or initials or under a pseudonym, as well as for those articles signed by several authors.

28. The editor is responsible for all textual, visual and audio appendages of the journalistic report. The equipment must faithfully express the content of the journalistic report.

29. If incorrect or substantially incomplete information, or information that otherwise violates the provisions of this Code, has been published in a newspaper, radio or television program or electronic publication, anyone who is directly or indirectly materially or potentially harmed by the publication of this information, has the right to rectification. The views of journalists and those of others passed on in a journalistic report are not subject to the right of correction.

30. A correction or rectification, in the part directly related to inaccurate or substantially incomplete information, must be published unchanged, in the same or equivalent place of the media space and in the same or equivalent way as the information to which the correction relates was published in. A correction may be published in an abridged or amended form only if the complainant agrees. The correction must be published in such a way that it is clear that it is a correction, and should not be published among the reactions or letters of the readers, or, the viewers and the listeners, without the consent of the applicant. In electronic publications, the correction and the information to which it relates must be interlinked. It is the duty of the editor to ensure that the correction is published as soon as possible. A comment or response to a correction may not be published with the correction in the same media release.

31. Covert advertising and promotional journalistic articles are not permitted. Whether paid or free, advertisements, like all paid information, must be clearly and unequivocally different from news articles.

### FINAL PROVISIONS 

A journalist who complies with this Code enjoys the support of his editorial staff and his professional organization. The Statute of the Croatian Journalists' Association set sanctions for violations of the Code. Editorial acts also establish responsibility for the application of the Code to journalists who are not members of HND. HND's Council of Honor is responsible for the protection and implementation of the Code. This Code has come into force on the day of its endorsement at the 50th Assembly of the Croatian Journalists' Association, held on November 27th 2009 in Opatija."
"26_HU";"Hungary ";"HU";"Self-regulatory ethical guidelines";"<h1>SELF-REGULATORY ETHICAL GUIDELINES</h1>
<p>By joining the Ethical Guidelines, we recognize and defend media freedom.</p>
<p>We declare that the most important tasks of the media are the following: the dissemination of information; the presentation of facts necessary for making informed voter, consumer and parental choices, among other topics; the promotion of free expression and the encouragement of a diversity of opinions; entertainment; and thereby the strengthening of society's self-awareness. To perform all these tasks, journalists need to be able to conduct their professional duty with freedom, without political or economic pressure, fear, or partiality. The signatories of these Ethical Guidelines declare that they acknowledge the obligation to disseminate accurate, fair, and factual information based on their best professional knowledge.</p>
<h3>The rules of conscientious dissemination of information</h3>
<p>The journalist performs his or her job:</p>
<ul>
<li>accurately, with a conviction of the truthfulness of the content published;</li>
<li>impartially, using equal standards to report on actors and cases;</li>
<li>without confusing personal conviction with facts, separating opinion from news genres;</li>
<li>fairly, respecting the private sphere, human dignity and rights;</li>
<li>courageously, without compromise, and undeterred by adverse pressure or threats;</li>
<li>free from manipulation, presenting events and processes rather than influencing them;</li>
<li>honourably, without trading information, without abusing the power of the public, and avoiding conflicts of interest;</li>
<li>by serving the interests of the audience, without being influenced by other interests, and acting in the pursuit of clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The rules of obtaining information and treating sources</h3>
<p>The source of information must be disclosed to the audience in a form either connected to a person or an institution, or indirectly, referring to the nature of the source. One must strive to openly reveal the sources, although anonymity is possible if the information cannot be otherwise obtained (see below for detailed rules). The source reference must record all significant factors influencing the information.</p>
<p>Journalists must behave as journalists under all circumstances. Therefore, the journalists need to inform the source as to why they need the information, when, and in what format this information is expected to be published. It is the responsibility of the journalist to inform his or her source of these rules. The only exception can be if the journalist cannot fulfil the requirement of conscientious dissemination of information in any other way, and the importance of the case involved justifies the exception. </p>
<p>Journalists shall not 'business' with information, cannot promise or accept unjust financial or other advantages, and shall not provide confidential information in exchange for information. Journalists shall not abuse the power of the public by extorting information from a person against a promise of hiding other information.</p>
<p>The journalist will do everything to become informed of data, decisions, and documents of public interest through official channels, complying with the provisions of effective media content laws on the obligation to inform, or the laws on the publishing of public-interest data. At the same time, if this official way fails, they are right to obtain the information through informal channels.</p>
<p>The journalist shall not reveal the identity of his or her source if such a promise was made, except if a court or other authority entitled by law obliges the journalist to do so. But even in such a situation the journalist must strive to avoid doing so by legal means.</p>
<p>The journalist and the interviewee consider the interview as a conversation for public disclosure, not as a private talk. The journalist renders the interviewee's words based on the accurate message of the interviewee, which does not necessarily mean a verbatim presentation. The journalist may only provide an opportunity to check the accuracy of the interview, but this does not allow any substantial posterior modification.</p>
<h3>Conflict of interest</h3>
<p>The journalist must avoid topics, contact sources, and information obtained from sources which inhibit the obtaining and processing of information in an unbiased manner (due to personal connection, bias, or interest). The journalist can undertake an assignment only if it does not raise a conflict of interest, or its semblance, working at the media outlet. The journalist cannot accept a job or other assignment, for financial compensation or not, from an organization, company, or person which might be the subject of the journalist's report. Based on editorial discretion, the nature of the relationship must be indicated to the audience when some kind of personal or institutional conflict of interest would inevitably influence the published material.</p>
<p>
The journalist cannot accept tokens of greater value than PR gifts, gifts, or other advantages (especially not, or not exclusively, travel of a professional nature, invitations to a dinner or a lunch of disproportionate value, extraordinary administration, special office treatment, 'journalist discounts') from an organization, company, or person, which would be a subject within a report. When choosing and sponsoring the representative goals and measures emerging during the work, the journalist proceeds according to the rules of reasonableness and decency, but obeys the principles detailed above.</p>
<p>The journalist can accept neither a temporary, nor a permanent income, nor an active role within organizations, parties, companies, in so far as this engagement has any connection with the topics covered by the journalist. This rule is valid in the case of taking or undertaking public offices, or similar commissions.</p>
<p>
The journalist, obtaining confidential information during his or her work (particularly financial, economic, commercial, and other pieces of information convertible to personal profit) cannot trade it to his or her personal advantage, and cannot pass the information to a third party before disclosing the information to the public.
</p>
<p>The journalist cannot participate in competitions, contests, or be awarded prizes, which are adjudicated by persons/organizations/companies covered regularly during his or her work. It is not a reason for exclusion if the supporters, announcers of the prizes are such organizations, but an autonomous, professional jury should be responsible for evaluating the competitions, or awarding the prizes.</p>
<p>The journalist cannot provide or promise publicity or special evaluation, or defend anyone in exchange for information. Similarly, the journalist should accept neither financial, nor other types of advantage in exchange for publishing or withholding information.</p>
<p>Doing his or her job, the journalist is obliged to communicate according to the norms of social interaction.</p>
<h3>Editorial independence, integrity, contact with the media organization</h3>
<p>An editorial board is typically a part of a media organization with legitimate business aims. As an employee of the organization, the journalist's job is to promote the achievement of the business aims of the organization, but this aim cannot confront the responsibility originating from the social role of journalism and the ethical traditions and rules reflecting it. Therefore, it is desirable that media companies recognize the editorial boards' integrity and content independence, and the editorial boards and the publishers cooperate to create a harmony between the business aims of the company and the highest standards of ethical and professional rules of journalism.</p>
<p>The editorial board is exclusively responsible for the content of the media outlet. The advertisers and sponsors (either directly or via the colleagues of the media organization) cannot exert pressure overtly or covertly on the editorial board, and such pressure must be rejected. Advertising revenue and advertisements as such are indispensable parts of the operation of the media, and their development seriously influences the strategies of publishers and thus the lives of the editorial boards. But it is necessary that this influence be limited and transparent, and should never influence concrete messages, so that the press can fulfil its role and be sustainable. The media organization cannot instruct the editorial board or its colleagues to prepare or not to prepare specific content, to publish or to reject information in such a way that would breach the principles listed in this code.</p>
<p>Editorial content and advertisements must be separated by clear signs in the media content. In case of product placement, described by law as a form of advertisement, attention must be called to the fact that the content does contain advertising.</p>
<h3>Public figures</h3>
<p>The journalist respects the constitutional, civil, and personal rights of those actors, with whom he or she communicates professionally. In case of public figures, the boundaries are much broader, but they qualify as public figures only if the case is connected to their roles as public figures, or if acts influence them, thus their role as public figures cannot give a reason for the press to examine every aspect of their lives. At the same time, in the case of public figures, it may be justified to publicly disclose certain details of their private life, family, financial situation, or even their health status if it affects their public duty, or if the public figure has willingly made the information.</p>
<p>The journalist considers the freedom of opinions regarding public figures to be broader than in other cases. It is appropriate to allow tough, or even provocative arguments, in justified cases compliant with the law.</p>
<p>The journalist considers public figures as follows, based on their activities: a) every person holding an elected office; b) every person serving as public officer; c) every person serving public duties; d) every person working before the public (actors, performers of programmes, musicians, other artists, sportsmen, church leaders, businessmen, journalists, university professors, vigilantes, lawyers participating in trials of public interest, leaders of sports clubs, etc.); e) every officer of state-owned companies either directly or indirectly to some extent, of companies in monopolistic positions, or of companies interested in public procurements participating in transactions connected to taxpayers' money.</p>
<p>We do not consider public figures to be those who are not in the public interest, or those who have attained such an interest inadvertently. For example, accident eyewitnesses, the relatives of public figures, crime victims, lottery winners, survivors of catastrophes would not be regarded as public figures.</p>
<h3>The rules of keeping contact with other media outlets</h3>
<p>The journalist is keenly aware of media competitors, but avoids unethical forms of gaining an advantage and respects their intellectual products. The journalist wishes to win the news competition primarily based on his or her own skills and not by impeding others in reaching information. The resource must be unambiguously indicated in cases of reporting primary sources from other editorial boards. Unauthorised ownership can apply only to new information and a proportionate part of the content.</p>
<p>The journalist complies with the rules of information in handling and keeping contact with public figures, before or even in case of working in collaboration with other journalists. The journalist does not reveal his or her source, and does not misuse the information. Before starting collaboration with others, the journalist clarifies rules with colleagues and observes the rules of correct referencing.</p>
<p>The journalist does not leak confidential or business information about his or her own media outlet, or the inner life of the editorial board.</p>
<h3>The protection of personal rights</h3>
<p>The journalist places emphasis on not breaching the constitutional, civil, and personal rights of those covered in any capacity during his or her work. The journalist ensures that the actors' personal data, or details of private lives are not published gratuitously (i.e. cannot be justified by public interest or reasonable private interest or is against persons' will) neither in the content nor in other ways, so long as this might affect them adversely in any ways, and the piece of information is not related to their public figure nature. Special attention must be paid to enforcing the personal and deceased rights of reputation of the victims of accidents, catastrophes, and crimes.</p>
<p>The journalist strictly respects the principles of presumption of innocence. Those suspected of crimes are denoted only by their first names and surname initials until a final and binding conviction. The reports do not contain other details, picture, or recordings by which the concerned could be identified. Anonymity may be lifted by the consent of the suspect or the defendant. In case of minor offenders, the complete name cannot be mentioned even after a final and binding conviction. If a public figure is accused of committing a crime, he or she is equally entitled to the presumption of innocence like anyone else, but it is justified and necessary to report his or her name and function. It must always be emphasized if there has been no final or binding conviction made on the reported case. If a media outlet reports about a case without legally binding decision, then it must report the final conviction as well, if the latter is more lenient or essentially different. The journalist proceeds by paying attention to every case when the actor is, for some reason, not in the position to represent his or her own interests fully (minors, the imprisoned, persons with disabilities, foreigners residing in Hungary, etc.).</p>
<p>The victims of crimes and accidents are entitled to a defence. Special proceedings must take place if the victim is a minor.</p>
<p>The journalist must strictly avoid publishing offensive or otherwise extreme arguments about people or groups of people. In justified cases, the journalist might give credence to actors' own opinions of such information. </p>
<h3>Shocking content</h3>
<p>Gratuitous material designed to shock the audience is to be avoided, be it written, audio, or visual in form. If the transmission of the given information is not solvable without the publication of such contents, then the audience must be informed as to the nature of the shocking content before it is transmitted.</p>
<p>It must be taken into account that easily recognizable brutal or sexual content may be disturbing or shocking for young or otherwise sensitive audiences, but it also may not be easily categorized. Accordingly, the rules described above concern content which offends, humiliates, or evokes extreme fear.</p>
<h3>Handling of errors and complaints</h3>
<p>If there is no doubt about the incorrectness of the published information (false information, or unfairly represented facts), then the error must be recognized and it must be corrected as clearly and quickly as possible. If the journalist takes information from another media outlet, then it must be accurately referenced. Opportunities for reply must be given to the person about whom the media outlet intends to publish substantive and new information, but this does not mean an obligation to cite any concerns verbatim, or to present it in its full extent.</p>
<p>Editorial boards will examine the complaints of readers, viewers, listeners, which question the principles listed in this document. The result will be disseminated and shared with the audience.</p>
<p>These principles will be regularly revised and, if necessary, amended.</p>

"27_IE";"Ireland";"IE";"Code of Practice";"# Journalists' Code of Practice

### Preamble

The freedom to publish is vital to the right of the people to be informed. This freedom includes the right of the press to publish what it considers to be news, without fear or favour, and the right to comment upon it.

Freedom of the press carries responsibilities. Members of the press have a duty to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards.

This Code sets the benchmark for those standards. It is the duty of the Press Ombudsman and Press Council of Ireland to ensure that it is honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter, and it is the duty of Press Council print and online media members (the press) to assist them in that task.

In dealing with complaints, the Ombudsman and Press Council will give consideration to what they perceive to be the public interest. It is for them to define the public interest in each case, but the general principle is that the public interest is invoked in relation to a matter capable of affecting the people at large so that they may legitimately be interested in receiving and the print and online news media legitimately interested in providing information about it.

### Principle 1 - Truth and Accuracy

1.1 In reporting news and information, the press shall strive at all times for truth and accuracy.

1.2 When a significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distorted report or picture has been published, it shall be corrected promptly and with due prominence.

1.3 When appropriate, a retraction, apology, clarification, explanation or response shall be published promptly and with due prominence.


### Principle 2 - Distinguishing Fact and Comment

2.1 The press is entitled to advocate strongly its own views on topics.

2.2 Comment, conjecture, rumour and unconfirmed reports shall not be reported as if they are fact. 

2.3 Readers are entitled to expect that the content of the press reflects the best judgment of editors and writers and has not been inappropriately influenced by undisclosed interests. Wherever relevant, any significant financial interest of an organization should be disclosed. Writers should disclose significant potential conflicts of interest to their editors.


### Principle 3 - Fair Procedures and Honesty

3.1 The press shall strive at all times for fair procedures and honesty in the procuring and publishing of news and information.

3.2 The press shall not obtain information, photographs or other material through misrepresentation or subterfuge, unless justified by the public interest.

3.3 Journalists and photographers must not obtain, or seek to obtain, information and photographs through harassment, unless their actions are justified in the public interest.


### Principle 4 - Respect for Rights

Everyone has constitutional protection for his or her good name. The press shall not knowingly publish matter based on malicious misrepresentation or unfounded accusations, and must take reasonable care in checking facts before publication.


### Principle 5 - Privacy

5.1 Privacy is a human right, protected as a personal right in the Irish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, which is incorporated into Irish law. The private and family life, home and correspondence of everyone must be respected.

5.2 Readers are entitled to have news and comment presented with respect for the privacy and sensibilities of individuals. However, the right to privacy should not prevent publication of matters of public record or in the public interest.

5.3 Sympathy and discretion must be shown at all times in seeking information in situations of personal grief or shock. In publishing such information, the feelings of grieving families should be taken into account. This should not be interpreted as restricting the right to report judicial proceedings.

5.4 Public persons are entitled to privacy. However, where people hold public office, deal with public affairs, follow a public career, or have sought or obtained publicity for their activities, publication of relevant details of their private life and circumstances may be justifiable where the information revealed relates to the validity of the their conduct, the credibility of their public statements, the value of their publicly expressed views or is otherwise in the public interest.

5.5 Taking photographs of individuals in private places without their consent is not acceptable, unless justified by the public interest.


### Principle 6 - Protection of Sources

Journalists shall protect confidential sources of information.


### Principle 7 - Court Reporting

The press shall strive to ensure that court reports (including the use of images) are fair and accurate, are not prejudicial to the right to a fair trial and that the presumption of innocence is respected.


### Principle 8 - Prejudice

The press shall not publish material intended or likely to cause grave offence or stir up hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, colour, ethnic origin, membership of the travelling community, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, illness or age.


### Principle 9 - Children

9.1 The press shall take particular care in seeking and presenting information or comment about a child under the age of 18.

9.2 Journalists and editors should have regard for the vulnerability of children, and in all dealings with children should bear in mind the age of the child, whether parental or other adult consent has been obtained for such dealings, the sensitivity of the subject-matter, and what circumstances if any make the story one of public interest. Young people should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion. The fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian must not be used as sole justification for publishing details of a child's private life.


### Principle 10 - Reporting of Suicide

In the reporting of suicide, excessive detail of the means of suicide should be avoided.


### Principle 11 - Publication of the Decision of the Press Ombudsman / Press Council

11.1 When requested or required by the Press Ombudsman and/or the Press Council to do so, the press shall publish the decision in relation to a complaint with due prominence.

11.2 The content of this Code will be reviewed at regular intervals.

"29_IS";"Iceland";"IS";"Icelandic Press Council Rules of Ethics in Journalism";" # Icelandic Press Council Rules of Ethics in Journalism

*In their work, journalists of all media must constantly bear in mind the basic rules of human relations, and the public's right to information, freedom of expression and criticism.*

### Clause 1

A journalist aims to do nothing which may bring his profession or professional organisation, newspaper or newsroom, into disrepute. He must avoid anything which may be deleterious to the public's opinion of the journalist's work, or damage the interests of the profession. A journalist must always be honourable in his dealings with colleagues.

### Clause 2

A journalist is aware of his personal responsibility for all that he writes. He bears in mind that he is generally perceived as a journalist, even when not expressing himself as such, in writing or the spoken word. A journalist respects necessary the confidentiality of his sources.

### Clause 3

A journalist observes the highest possible standards in gathering information, processing this information, and in presenting it, and shows the utmost tact in sensitive cases. He avoids all that may cause unnecessary pain or humiliation to the innocent, or those who have suffered.

### Clause 4

Should a journalist accept a bribe or use threats in connection with publication of material, this is counted a very serious violation. Journalists must always be conscious of when names should be published for the sake of public safety, or in the public interest. In accounts of legal and criminal cases, journalists must observe the general rule that every person is innocent until proven guilty.

### Clause 5

A journalist must do his best to avoid conflicts of interest, for instance by not reporting on companies or interest groups in which he himself is involved. He must primarily serve the interests of the reader, and the honour of the journalistic profession in all that he undertakes under the aegis of his job.

A journalist writes always on the basis of his convictions. He makes sure not to confuse editorial material of clear informative and educational value with advertising in pictorial and / or written form.

This code of ethics does not limit the freedom of expression of journalists who write, under their full name, clearly defined items in newspapers, e.g. criticism, where the writer's personal views are of the essence.

### Clause 6

Any person who believes that a journalist has offended against the above code, and whose interests are at stake, can make a complaint to the Ethics Committee of the Icelandic Union of Journalists within two months of publication, provided the item published is not the subject of court action at the same time.

The complainant must, however, previously have sought redress from the organ (newspaper, broadcasting company) in question. The Ethics Committee can, however, decide to make an exception to the rule on seeking redress, due to other circumstances. The Ethics Committee shall discuss the matter at a meeting within one week and shall announce a well-grounded ruling as soon as possible.

When the Ethics Committee undertakes to investigate a complaint, it must take into account the overall coverage of the matter in the medium against which be given the complaint has been made. The respondent shall be given the opportunity to explain his view of the matter.

The Ethics Committee recognises three categories of violation, according to their nature:

a) reprehensible

b) serious

c) very serious.

No appeal can be made against the Ethics Committee's ruling. The ruling of the Ethics Committee, together with the grounds and arguments of the ruling, shall be published as soon as possible in the journalists' union periodical. The Ethics Committee's ruling shall be sent to the organ in question at the first opportunity, with a request for publication in the case of an offence in category b) or c). Three days later, the ruling shall be sent to other media.

The principal ruling of the committee shall be published word for word. In presentation of news on rulings from the Ethics Committee, journalists shall observe all precautions which this code lays down, cp. clauses 1 and 2 above.

 *(Adopted by the Icelandic Press Council in 1988)*"
"30_IT";"Italy";"IT";"Charter of Duties of Journalists";"# Charter of Duties of Journalists 

*Adopted by the National Federation of the Italian Press and National Council Order of Journalists in Rome on 8 July 1993.*



### Introduction


A journalist's job is based on principles of freedom of information and of opinions. It is confirmed by the Italian Constitution and governed by the second article of the Italian law no. 1969 dated on 3 February 1963.

Freedom of information and of expression are the inalienable rights of all journalists. They are limited by the observance of the rules of law and subject to the protection of other people's personality. They always follow all duties set by fealty and good faith. The respect of the truth of facts is an unbreakable duty. All incorrect news must be rectified, and mistakes must be corrected.

Journalists and publishers are obliged to respect professional secrecy on the sources of a piece of information, when it is required by the fiduciary character of them; they have to promote the spirit of collaboration between colleagues, the co-operation between journalists and publishers, and the trust in press and in readers.'

The relationship of trust between information organs and the people is the foundation of every journalists' job. To promote and cement this relationship, all Italian journalists sign the following Ethics Code (Carta de Doveri).



### Principles


A journalist has to respect, cultivate and defend the right of information for all people; for these reasons he researches and diffuses every piece of information that he considers of public interest in observance of truth and accuracy.

A journalist researches and spreads news of public interest in spite of the obstacles which can arise in his work; he makes any effort to guarantee to people knowledge and control of all public documents.

A journalist's responsibility towards people always prevails above any other thing. A journalist can never subordinate his responsibility to other people's interest and particularly to the publishers' interest, governments' interest or of the other organizations of the State.

A journalist has to respect people, his dignity and his right of secrecy, and he never discriminates between people according to their race, their religion, their sex, their mental and physical condition, or their political views.

A journalist rectifies, swiftly and accurately, his mistakes or his imprecisions in conformity with the duty to rectify and with what is established by law.

A journalist always respects the right of presumption of innocence.

A journalist has to observe the professional secrecy, when it is required by the fiduciary character of his sources. In any other cases a journalist has to respect the transparency of the sources.

A journalist can not adhere to secret associations or act in any way in conflict with the eighteenth article of the Italian Constitution.

A journalist cannot accept benefits, favours or tasks that make dependent his autonomy and his professional credibility. A journalist cannot omit facts or essential details for a complete reconstruction of events. Titles, summaries, photos and subtitles must not either distort reality or change the content of articles and news.

A journalist must not publish images and photos of people involved in daily episodes particularly terrifying, taking care to preserve people's dignity. Nor must he dwell upon details of violence or brutality, unless there is a pre-eminent reason of social interest. He must not interfere with reality to create artificial images.

Comments and opinions belong to the right of speech and of criticism and, therefore, they have to be absolutely free from any obligation, except for the constraint set by law against offence, defamation and violence against people.



### Duties


**A journalist's responsibility**


A journalist is responsible for his job towards people. He has to favour their dialogue with the ombudsman. He has to create various instruments (reader's guarantee, pages for readers, spaces for reply etc.), giving a wide diffusion to their activity.

A journalist only accepts suggestions and instructions from the editorial hierarchy of his newspaper, as long as the dispositions are not against the professional law, against the national Italian journalist's work contract (CNLG) and are in accordance with the Ethics Code (Carta di Doveri).

A journalist cannot discriminate between people according to their race, their religion, their mental and physical conditions, or their political opinions.

Extenuating circumstances, insulting or denigratory references concerning people and their privacy, are only acceptable when they are of relevant public interest.

A journalist respects the right of secrecy of every person, and he cannot publish news of their private life, unless they are transparent and of relevant public interest. However, he always makes his identity and profession known when he collects such news.

Names of the relations of people involved in such daily events cannot be published, unless they are of relevant public interest; nor can they be made known in case of danger of people's safety, nor can publish other elements be published, that can make clear people's identity (photos, images).

Names of victims of sexual violence can be neither published, nor can the journalist give details that can lead to their identification, unless it is required by the victims themselves for relevant general interest.

A journalist has to proceed with great caution in publishing names or elements that can lead to the identification of members of the legal team or of the police, when they can provoke the risk of endangerment for themselves or their families.


**Rectification and reply**


A journalist respects the inviolable people's right to the rectification of incorrect news or wrong facts that are considered prejudicial to people's interests.

A journalist makes rectification, therefore, with timeliness and appropriate emphasis, also in case of a lack of a specific required of all news that, after their wide diffusion (spreading), seem to be incorrect or erroneous, especially when the mistakes can damage people, organizations, categories, associations and communities.

When a journalist makes a charge against people, he does not spread news damaging a person's reputation or dignity without giving the opportunity of reply to the person concerned. Should this be impossible (because the person is impossible to find or he doesn't want to reply) he has to inform the readers and the public of this fact. In any case, before publishing a piece of news concerning the investigations' warning by a judge, he has to establish whether the charged person is aware of it.


**Presumption of innocence**


In all the process and investigations, a journalist has always to remember that every person charged of an offence is innocent until the final judgement. He must not spread news in order to introduce him as guilty person when he has not been judged guilty in such a process.

A journalist must not publish images that present deliberately or artificially as offenders people that have not been judged as guilty persons in a process.

In case of the accused's acquittal a journalist has always to give an appropriate journalistic emphasis to the piece of news, also giving a referral to all news and articles previously published.



### Sources


A journalist has to observe the maximum caution in spreading news, names and images of charged people for habitual offences of a minor nature, except in case of particular social interest.

A journalist has to check all information obtained from his sources. He must accept responsibility for what he says, and must always safeguard the substantial truth of facts.

In cases here the sources require anonymity, a journalist has to respect the professional secret and has to be able to inform the reader of such circumstance.

In any other case a journalist must always respect the principle of more transparency of the sources of information, giving the readers or the audience the maximum and possible attention to them. The fulfilment of an obligation to the quotation of a source is particularly important when a journalist uses a piece of news from a press agency or from any other source of information, unless the piece of news is not correct or widely spread with own means, or unless it is modified as far as the meaning and the content are concerned.

In all the other cases a journalist accept conditioning derived from the sources for the publication or the abolition of a piece of information.


**Information and advertising**


All people have the right to receive correct information, always distinct from an advertising message and not prejudicial to everyone's interests. The advertising message must always be distinguishable from journalistic documents through clear indications.

A journalist has to observe all principles signed in the Protocol's Agreement on Transparency of Information and of the national Italian journalists' work contract (CNLG); he has to make known the advertisement, however, he has to enable people to recognize a journalistic job from a promotional message.


**Incompatibility**


A journalist can never use economic or financial information that he knows to his personal benefit, nor can he disturb the state of the stock market, spreading news and events that are to his own advantage. 

A journalist cannot write articles or news concerning the trend of the market in which he has a direct or indirect financial interest. He cannot sell or buy stock in which he is professionally involved or with which he is going to be concerned shortly.

A journalist refuses payments, refund of expenses, donations, free holidays, duty travels, pleasure trip gifts, or facilities, that can damage his credibility and professional dignity.

A journalist cannot accept tasks which conflict with the autonomous discharge of his own duties, nor lend his name, voice or image for advertising enterprises that are incompatible with the safeguarding of a professional journalists' autonomy.

He is allowed, instead, to give free of charge some services for advertising enterprises, for a social, humanitarian, cultural, religious or artistic task, or for a trade union. However, this must be without a speculative character.


**Children or weak people**


A journalist respects all principles confirmed in the ONU Convention dated 1989 on the right of children and their rules undersigned by the 'Treviso Ethic Code' (Carta di Treviso) to protect children, their character and their personality, both as an active protagonist and as a victim of a common-law offence and particularly:

a) a journalist doesn't publish a name or any other element that can lead to the identification of people involved in the daily episodes or events;
b) he has to avoid eventual instrumentalizations by all adults that brings to represent and make exclusively his own interest;
c) however, he values if the spread of the news concerning children brings effectively to the interest of the minor himself.

A journalist protects the rights and dignity of people with mental or physical handicap in analogy with what is confirmed by the Treviso Ethic Code (Carta di treviso) about children.

A journalist protects the rights of the invalid, avoiding sensational publication of news on medical arguments that can bring fear and groundless hopes.

a) he does not spread news that is not confirmed by important scientific sources
b) he does not quote the name of commercial drugs and products in order to favour a consumer product.
c) he spreads in timely fashion the commercial names of pharmaceutical products that are withdrawn or suspended from circulation because they damage people's health.

A journalist pledges to use maximum respect towards subjects of daily life that for social, economical or cultural reasons can be regarded as minor instruments of self protection.

"31_LK";"Sri Lanka";"LK";"Code of Professional Practice (Code of Ethics) of The Editors' Guild of Sri Lanka";"<h1>Code of Professional Practice (Code of Ethics) of The Editors' Guild of Sri Lanka</h1>
<p><em>Adopted by the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka</em></p>
<h3>1. PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>This code of practice, which is binding on newspaper publishing companies, Editors and their journalists and contributors both in print format and online, aims to ensure that the Sri Lankan press is free and responsible and sensitive to the needs and expectations of its readers, while maintaining the highest standards of journalism.</p>
<p>Those standards require newspapers to strive for accuracy and professional integrity, and to uphold the best traditions of investigative journalism in the public interest, unfettered by distorting commercialism or by improper pressure or by narrow self-interest, which conspires against press freedom. Newspapers and journalists, while free to hold and express their own strong opinions, should give due consideration to the views of others and endeavour to reflect social responsibility.</p>
<p>This code both protects the rights of the individual and upholds the public's right to know. It should be honoured not only to the letter but in the spirit – neither interpreted so narrowly as to compromise its commitment to respect the rights of the individual nor so broadly as to prevent publication in the public interest.</p>
<p>Editors should co-operate swiftly with the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka (PCCSL) in the resolution of complaints. Any publication judged to have breached the Code must print the adjudication in full and with due prominence, including a headline reference to the PCCSL.</p>
<h3>2. ACCURATE REPORTING</h3>
<ol>
<li>The media must take all reasonable care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorting news, photographs and other images. Any significant digital manipulation of images should be labelled.</li>
<li>Every reasonable attempt should be made by editors and individual journalists to verify the accuracy of reports prior to publication. Where such verification is not practicable, that fact shall be stated in the report.</li>
<li>Editors and their staff, including external contributors, shall not publish material in such a way as to endorse any matter which they know or have reason to believe to be false or inaccurate.</li>
<li>Plagiarism must be avoided. Legitimate use of other people's work should be duly attributed.</li>
<li>The press must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. CORRECTIONS and APOLOGIES</h3>
<ol>
<li>Where it is recognized by the editor that a report was incorrect in a material respect, it should be corrected promptly and with due prominence and with an apology where appropriate, except where the correction or apology is against the wishes of the aggrieved party.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. OPPORTUNITY TO REPLY</h3>
<ol>
<li>A fair and reasonable opportunity to reply should be given to individuals or organizations in respect of factually incorrect statements endangering their reputation, dignity, honour, feelings, privacy and office. The mutually agreed reply should be confined to the complainant's version of the facts and no longer than necessary to correct the alleged inaccuracy.</li>
<li>Newspapers or journalists who respond to a complainant's reply other than to apologize or regret the error, must then be prepared to offer the aggrieved party a fresh opportunity to reply.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES</h3>
<ol>
<li>Every journalist has a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information, until that source authorizes otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6. GENERAL REPORTING and WRITING</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In dealing with social issues of a particularly shocking or emotionally painful nature – such as atrocity, violence, drug abuse, brutality, sadism, sexual salacity and obscenity – the press should take special care to present facts, opinions, photographs and graphics with due sensitivity and discretion, subject to its duty to publish in the public interest.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>When reporting suicide, care should be taken not to give excessive detail of the method used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>7. PRIVACY</h3>
<ol>
<li>The press shall exercise particular care to respect the private and family lives of individuals, their home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. Intrusions on this right to privacy without consent could be justified only by some over- riding public interest.</li>
<li>The use of long-lens or other cameras to photograph people without consent on private or public property where there is a reasonable expectation or privacy is unacceptable, unless in the public interest.</li>
<li>Particular care should be taken to ensure that in cases involving grief or shock, inquiries and approaches are handled with sensitivity and discretion.</li>

Publication of material concerning a child's private life would be acceptable only if there was some exceptional public interest other than the fame, notoriety or position of his or her family or guardian.</li>
<li>The restrictions on intruding into privacy are particularly relevant to inquiries about individuals in hospitals or similar institutions, unless it serves the public interest.</li>
</ol>

If such conflict is unavoidable, it should normally be disclosed to the reader.</li>
<li>
<p>a. Even where the law does not prohibit it, journalists must not use for their own profit financial information they receive in advance of its general publication, nor should they pass such information for the profit of others.</p>
<p>b. They must not write about shares or securities in whose performance they know that they or their close families have a significant financial interest, without disclosing the interest to the publisher, editor or financial editor.</p>
</li>
<li>Articles written for payment or other benefit from a commercial or other non- editorial source, such as in advertorials or promotions, should be clearly labelled as such. Payment should not be sought or accepted as a reward for including favourable – or excluding hostile – editorial material.</li>

<h3>Part III</h3>
<p><strong>Comments article by article</strong></p>
<p>It is recalled that thereafter any reference to the law of 8 June 2004 on the freedom of expression in the media is designated by the terms &quot;law&quot; provided that there is no ambiguity.</p>

Is treated as a journalist editor natural person who participates personally and regularly to their collection, analysis, commentary and the editorial processing of information.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 2 Subject</strong></p>
<p>Freedom entails rights and obligations. The Press Council, in its mission to defend freedom of the press and that granted during the debates Parliamentarians on the Law of 8 June 2004 on the freedom of expression in the media and especially in the motion of 13 May 2004 by the Chamber of Deputies established with this Code of Ethics rules inherent in the operation the press and the exercise of freedom of expression in the media.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 3 From freedom of expression</strong></p>
<p>Section 6 of the Act establishes not only the right to information but also the right to communicate information, to comment and criticize. Freedom of the press is based on the social role assigned to the media and information professionals in a democratic society. This role is search, collect, process, review and disseminate unhindered information public interest necessary for the existence and maintenance of democratic life. The press freedom arises from fundamental freedoms of thought, speech, of expression and opinion recognized in various legal documents, the plan nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>As an extension of the above freedoms, the right to information takes root in recognition of the legitimate interest of the public to be informed. It specifies the conditions for the exercise of a free press in a democratic society, and the prerogatives and responsibilities of those whose primary function is inform. The right to be informed includes the right of the media and journalists to seek and transmit information without hindrance or constraints, and the public's right to access freely.</p>
<p>For this purpose, it is necessary to recall the main principles set out in the Declaration Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention of the Council of Europe. &quot;All Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right not to freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart considerations impart information and ideas through any expression whatsoever. &quot;(Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and freedom to receive and impart information and ideas there can be no interference by public authority and regardless of border. &quot;(Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe)</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 4 From the accuracy and truthfulness</strong></p>
<p>a) monitoring the accuracy and veracity of the information is essential to maintaining high standards of professional press. However, when despite reasonable efforts, given the situation, the information remains doubtful, it must be allowed the press to impart information by hand his doubts. It is the commitment to publish only the information that sources are credible and score information from unreliable sources as such.</p>
<p>b) Section 11 of the Act provides that any misrepresentation of fact contained in a publication must be corrected spontaneously when the inaccuracy on the presentation is concerned is established or when the employee concerned or the publisher had knowledge. The Code of Ethics adopted these considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 5 Respect for others</strong></p>
<p>a) This article deals with direct discrimination. Remember about Article II-21 of the draft European Constitution Treaty says: &quot;Is prohibited any discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. &quot;</p>
<p>There exist forms of communication, not directly incite discrimination or hatred, can help to create an atmosphere in public negative feelings towards a community. An example drawn from everyday practice is an indication of the color of skin a challenged whenever it is not white. It recommends that the press shows the racial, national or Ethnic a person when this information is necessary to understand the facts or where there is a direct link to the information. It is the same sex, language, culture, social class, disease, physical or mental disability or religious belief, political or ideological person.</p>
<p>b) The press agrees not to defend or glorify acts of violence, brutality or cruelty.</p>
<p>c) Any person, whether public or not known, has a fundamental right to privacy, privacy, dignity and respect for the reputation. The public, its part, the right to be informed about what is in the public interest and the press has a duty the know. Whether in the collection, processing or dissemination of information, media and journalists should exercise caution, discernment and caution. They should worry about actually informing the public, and must be the necessary distinctions between what is public interest and what is the public curiosity. The law about the respect the privacy of the person in Articles 14 15 and a number of conditions that must be observed.</p>
<p>d) The legislature, in various related laws, grants special protection to minors, so as not to jeopardize their social development and family. Journalistic ethics also requires compliance with specific tags in the collection, processing and dissemination of information on minors, specifically regarding their identification.</p>
<p>When the press considers it appropriate to inform the public about legal issues minors, it shall not publish any mention clean to allow identification, whether they are involved as accused, victims or witnesses of traumatic events.</p>
<p>Outside the judicial context, the media and journalists should also be guided in the exercise of their professional responsibilities by the principle of respect the anonymity of youth, including security and development could be compromised. Thus, the press should refrain from giving details that allow the identification of young stigmatized, whether as victims, third innocent or because they live in serious personal difficulties. The law in Articles 18 and 19 on certain provisions of the protection of minors.</p>
<p>e) The Universal Charter of Human Rights because of the presumption of innocence a fundamental right: &quot;Everyone charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which all the guarantees necessary for his defense was insured. &quot;The press adheres to this principle without restrictions. The law specifies the obligations of the media in the context of legal proceedings in Articles 12 and 13.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the press of business taking place outside seize judicial proceedings, but within the public interest to know. In this case, the press provides with all the usual recautions to respect the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>In the absence of legal proceedings, the journalists will be cautious before revealing the identity of suspects, unless the suspicions are the result of a rigorous journalistic work to bring to light socially reprehensible acts.</p>
<p>The distinction between legal and business procedures that take place outside the court to explain the wording: &quot;… and avoid publicly present a person guilty of such facts before any official confirmation. &quot;Instead of usual formulation &quot;… before any final judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>f) The information provided in the media is in the public domain. One can therefore be refer, in reporting the substance or quoted. In terms of information, the work of other media can be useful to journalists. However, the fact that information is disseminated in media does not justify If another media copy or reproduce impunity without mentioning source or without the permission of the author. Not only legislation concerning copyright, neighboring rights and databases that disapproves but it is also a matter of professional ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 6 From independence</strong></p>
<p>Necessary to freedom of opinion and expression is provided independence the press. The last day with reasonable care to prevent itself anything that might call into question its independence. Paragraphs of this section dealing with different scenarios that could compromise their independence.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 7 From secret sources and obtaining information</strong></p>
<p>a) The law provides for the protection of sources in Article 7. However, some cases that have arisen since the entry into force show that protection remains fragile as those concerned did not yet have the experience and necessary routines. After meeting with the State Attorney, the Council of Press plans to instruct its chairman or the lack of it a vice-Presidents or his duly authorized representative with the mission to attend any searches to ensure, at any place, that the protection of journalists' sources is respected.</p>
<p>b) The press is committed to identifying individuals with sources information and inform, in any given situation, of its intention to communicate to the public the information gathered. This article is intended to alert the people unaccustomed to contact with the press. Individuals must be aware that they are testimonies to a journalist can find their impact to a wide audience.</p>
<p>c) Some codes of conduct are limited to say the ban unfair use ie work under cover for information. If this rule is applicable in most of journalistic work, it can not however be absolute. The scandal of &quot;Watergate,&quot; to take one example most spectacular in the history of journalism, would never come to the public knowledge without the use of non-conventional methods. But in many cases, these practices are necessary for many other subjects such as investigations in the consumer interest (test-purchases, eg). The chosen article thus serves to educate the journalist not to abuse these methods, while leaving him the right to the range of methods when interest public demands. Press inform the public use of these means in accordance with the principle of protection of sources and taking into account the interest of the public to be informed the status of the species.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 8 In the reporting</strong></p>
<p>a) Generally, the rule adopted by this article is the principle of separation of facts and comment. As Luxembourg, the press release is an opinion, limiting the simple recommendation to separate facts and comments do not seem enough. This leads to the conclusion that physical separation between information and comment is necessary, that is to say, should be published two articles distinct.</p>
<p>However, it should be qualified. When the public can distinguish even within a single article, what are the facts on the one hand, and what opinions journalist and the other comments, the rule is supposed respected. In many cases, the formulation of a title, the use of an adjective is already the expression of an opinion, an evaluation of the journalist. Use these means to attract the attention of the public may be in conflict with the rule. And up to the journalist to be aware of.</p>
<p>b) This provision is justified by the fact that more formal sources of companies bring news services providing media press &quot;ready&quot;. So the press is it called to be particularly vigilant to enable the public to distinguish between work journalistic and press others.</p>
<p>c) Respect for the right of moral author implies that the name of the author or have a source of information is reproduced.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 9 From the picture, sound and audiovisual</strong></p>
<p>Ethical rules apply to all media so as to those of image, sound and audiovisual. It is necessary to set some specific rules on the image, due to the opportunities that arise from technical and enable all kinds of manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 10 Electronic Media and the Internet</strong></p>
<p>The electronic media are a significant and growing importance in the modern information society, so it is worth noting that the code Ethics obviously applies to the disclosure of information by the media.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 11 From the business and financial information</strong></p>
<p>a) The announcements and advertisements must be submitted in such a way that the public can not be confused with journalistic information.</p>
<p>b) The press is free to deal independently of topics such as trade, traders, trading companies, products and services, various new markets. Although in these cases the distinction between information is hidden and difficult to advertising, the press must in any avoid because not encourage the purchase. Comparisons and recommendations for products or services based on However, objective criteria are possible.</p>
<p>c) In the context of this article, it is necessary to refer to the specific provisions the law on market abuse. This component is particularly sensitive, the Press Council will ensure that the provisions in this area, existing or future, are sent to the media concerned.</p>
<p>d) Members of the press should avoid removing, directly or indirectly, an advantage or profits inside information which they may knowledge in the exercise of their profession.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 12 From the treatment of personal data</strong></p>
<p>The Act of 2 August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data information obligations regarding the treatment data produced as part of freedom of expression in Article 9.</p>
<p>It is envisaged to amend the legislation so as to give the Commission the Complaints of the Press Council mission to address any claim of a person Private sue media for data protection. The right Access to information can be exercised only in the presence of the President of Press Council or his representative.</p>
<p>Intervention of the National Commission for Data Protection not will only alternative in case the decision of the Claims Commission does not give satisfaction to the applicant. The right of access to the data can never be the origin of the data. There are will not be in order to affect the diffusion of publication.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 13 Advertising Code of Ethics</strong></p>
<p>The law instructs the Press Council to ensure the publication of the Code of Ethics leaving the choice of means of publication in the Press Council.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Art. 14 Entry into force</strong></p>
<p>This Code repeals and replaces the Code of Ethics adopted by the Assembly plenary of the Press Council of 4 December 1995.</p>
<p>It shall enter into force on the day following its approval by the plenary of the Press Council. It is the same in the updated Code of Ethics.

<h1>Codex of Montenegrin Journalists</h1>
<p><em>A journalist serves public interest. Credibility of journalists and journalist profession generally rests on professional honesty, integrity and knowledge. It is of the interest of every journalist, and it is his duty, to observe this Codex.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Duty of a journalist is to respect the truth and persistently search for it, having in mind a right of the public to be informed and human need for justice and humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to defend freedom and the right to collect and announce information without being disturbed as well as to give free comments and critics. A journalist should be sharp observer of those who have social, political and economic power. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facts should be sacred for a journalist, and it is his duty to put them in the right context and prevent their misuse, whether it is a text, picture or a tone. Rumors and assumptions should be clearly marked as such. It is a duty to clearly separate news from a comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a duty of a journalist to complete an incomplete and correct incorrect information, especially the one that can cause any harm and at the same time to make sure that the correction is pointed out in the adequate manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One's race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation and family status will be mentioned by a journalist only if that is necessary for the information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to collect information in any form, a journalist should use professionally honorable and legally allowed methods. Any violation of this rule is allowed only in cases when those methods are not sufficient, and information that is to be obtained of the great importance for the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a right and duty of a journalist to protect confidential information sources, but also always to check motives of the confidential source before one is promised anonymity and protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to be very careful when dealing with private life of people. A right to private life is disproportional to the importance of a public function that an individual performs, but in those cases, it is necessary to respect human dignity as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to protect integrity of adolescent persons, different and disabled persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reporting on investigation and court procedures, a journalist has to respect the assumption that everyone is innocent until is proved differently and should by no means pre-adjudicate the outcome of a court procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist should not accept privileges of any kind that could limit or bring into suspicion his autonomy and impartiality, and affect freedom of a publisher and editorial board to make decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a duty of a journalist to maintain solidarity in relation with his colleagues in the extent that would not prevent him to properly perform professional task, or to make him violate basic principles of the journalist codex. Just as he is ready to expose his work to the public judgment, a journalist should be willing to expose himself to judgment of an impartial body that takes care of the profession authority protection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Interpretation and implementation of basic principles of the codex</strong></p>
<h3>1. Guidelines for Principle 1</h3>
<p><strong>1. General standards</strong></p>
<p>Journalists must maintain the highest professional and ethical standards. They must take all reasonable steps to ensure that they disseminate only accurate information, and that their comments on events are genuine and honest. They must never publish information that they know to be false or maliciously make unfounded allegations about others that are intended to harm their reputations. It is journalist's right to refuse an assignment being opposite to the ethic codex.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>(a) Before publishing a report, the journalist must ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to check its accuracy. Journalists must endeavor to provide full reports of events and must not be silent about or suppress essential information. </p>
<p>(b) The public's right to be informed does not justify sensational reporting. Therefore, journalists must not distort information by exaggeration, by placing improper emphasis on one aspect of a story or by giving only one side of the story. They must avoid using misleading headlines or advertising slogans. The facts must not be distorted by reporting them out of the context in which they occurred.</p>
<p><strong>3. Press releases</strong></p>
<p>Press releases and statements issued by public authorities, political parties, public services, associations, clubs or other lobby groups must be clearly defined as such.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rallies during Election Campaign</strong></p>
<p>When contributing from rallies organized during an election campaign, the reporters will also report on the views and values with which they may not agree. Such an approach is a matter of reporter's fairness; it serves the citizens' right to the freedom of information and supports the principle of equal opportunities for all political parties and other participants in the election process.</p>
<h3>3. Guidelines for Principle 3</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Comment
The comment must be a genuine expression of opinion based on facts. Comment must not be presented in such a way as to create the impression that it is an established fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interviews
(a) An interview is completely journalistically correct if the interviewee or his/her
representative has authorized it, or if it is obvious that there is interviewee's approval for the intention to publish unauthorized interview. If time is short, it is also correct to
publish statements in unauthorized interview form if it is clear to both the interviewer and the interviewee that the statements are to be published either verbatim or as an edited version. If the text of an interview is reproduced in full or in part, the publication concerned must state its source. If the basic content of verbally expressed thoughts is paraphrased, it is nonetheless a matter of journalistic honor to state the source.
(b) In the case of advanced reports of an interview in abridged form, care must be taken that abridgment does not stand out from contents of program context that is abridged. In this case as well, care must be taken to protect the interviewee against any distortions or impairments, which may jeopardize his or her dignity or legitimate interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic images
(a) If an illustration, especially a photograph may leave an impression on an average reader that it is an authentic document, in spite of the fact that it is merely a symbolic picture, such a case must be made clear. Photo-montage or other modifications of authentic documents must be clearly marked as such in the accompanying text or in any other, appropriate way.
(b) If the media use reconstructed scenes in broadcasting/printing, such act must be recognizable for the audience or it must be clearly indicated by the voice or by the text.
(c) Archival materials used on television must be necessarily marked as such, and sound inserts used from the radio archives must be announced as such by voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embargoes
The imposition of embargoes during which the publication of certain information is held over is justifiable only if it is vital for objective and careful reporting. In principle, embargoes are a free agreement between informants and the media. Embargoes should be observed only if there is an objectively justifiable reason, such as in the case of speeches still to be held, advance copies of company reports and other types of activities or information on a future event (meetings, resolutions, honors, ceremonies, etc.). Embargoes must not be used for taking advantage over competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opinion poll findings
In publishing findings by opinion poll agencies, the media should give the number of respondents, the date of the poll, the identity of the person or organization that commissioned it, and the questions asked. If the agency was not commissioned to carry out the poll, it should be pointed out that it was implemented at the initiative of the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily Polling/Interviewing
In the case of daily, ad hoc, polling of citizens about controversial social issues (vox-pop stories), a special dose of precaution is needed in order to avoid possible manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters to the Editor
(a) By means of letters to the editor, insofar as they are suitable in terms of form and content, readers/listeners/viewers should have the opportunity to express their views and thus participate in the opinion-shaping process. It is in line with the journalistic duty of due diligence to observe the Code when publishing such letters.
(b) Correspondence with publishers or editorial departments can be printed as letters to the editor if it is clear, due to their form and content that this is in accordance with the sender's wishes. Consent may be assumed if the letter refers to articles and stories published by the media concerned or to matters of general interest. Media are not legally bound to publish such letters.
(c) It is common practice that letters to the editor are published with the author's name. Only in exceptional cases can, at the request of the author, the name of the author withheld with the notice: ‘Name is known to the editor'. The media should not publish the authors' addresses. If there is any doubt about the identity of the sender, a letter should not be printed. The publication of fake letters is not compatible with the duties of the media.
(d) Abridgments are possible if the Letters to the Editor section contains a permanent notice that the editor reserves the right to shorten such letters without changing the meaning of them. Should the sender expressly forbid changes or abridgments, the editorial department must either comply with that wish, even if it has reserved the right to abridgment, or decline to publish the letter.
(e) All readers'/listeners'/viewers' letters sent to the editor are subject to editorial secrecy. They must never be passed on to third parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Guidelines for principle 4</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Corrections
(a) If a media institution discovers that it has published a report containing a significant distortion of the facts, it must publish a correction promptly and with comparable prominence. This correction must refer to the previous incorrect report.
(b) If a media institution discovers that it has published an erroneous report that has caused harm to a person's or institution's reputation, it must publish an apology promptly and with due prominence.
(c) “Due prominence” in this context means publication of the correction in the same space (in the case of print media) or within the same programme (in the case of broadcast media).
(d) Where a person or organization believes that a media report contains inaccurate information or has unfairly criticized the person or organization, the media institution concerned must give the person or organization a fair opportunity to reply, to correct any inaccuracies and to respond to the criticism. Media institution is expected to provide such right in the case of acceptance that the report in question had errors and unfounded allegations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation
In cases where incorrect reports are discovered, as outlined in 4.1, the media institution must correct them also in their archives, documentation, and databases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Guidelines for principle 5</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hate speech
(a) Media institutions must not publish material that is intended or is likely to engender hostility or hatred towards persons on the grounds of their race, ethnic origins, nationality, gender, physical disabilities, religion or political affiliation. The same applies if it is highly probable that publication of a material may cause the above stated hostility and hatred
(b) Journalists must take utmost care to avoid contributing to the spread of ethic hatred when reporting events and statements of this nature. It is journalist's duty to respect other states and nations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports on crime
When reporting crimes, it is not permissible to refer to the suspect's religious, ethnic or other minority membership unless this information can be justified as being relevant to the audience's understanding of the incident. In particular, it must be borne in mind that such references could stir up prejudices against groups in need of protection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>6. Guidelines for principle 6</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research
(a) Research is an indispensable instrument of the journalistic duty of due diligence.
(b) Journalists should normally use open methods of gathering information in which they clearly identify themselves as such. Untrue statements by a journalist about his/her identity and their publication when doing research work are irreconcilable with the standing and function of the media.
(c) Undercover research may only be used where other methods have failed to yield information of particular public interest. These methods may thus be employed where, for example, they will help to detect or expose criminal activity, abuse of power, or will bring to light information that will protect the public against serious threats to public health and safety and the environment.
(d) In the event of accidents and natural disasters, the media must bear in mind that emergency services for the victims and those in danger have priority over the public right to information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research among people requiring protection
Research should be carried out and approaches made with sympathy and discretion in cases involving personal grief or shock, people who are not in full possession of their mental or physical powers, as well as children and juveniles. The limited willpower or the special situation of such people must not be exploited deliberately to gain information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclusive information
It is standard practice for journalists to publish exclusive information and stories. Such stories should be created by research and not by seeking monopolies of information within public authorities. Public authorities should disseminate their information without favoring a limited number of media houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment for information
Journalists must not pay people to act as information sources unless there is demonstrable public interest value in the information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>7. Guidelines for principle 7</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality
(a) Where a person has agreed to supply information only on condition that his or her identity remains confidential and the journalist agrees to this condition, the journalist must respect this undertaking and refuse to reveal the identity of the source. However, the journalist has to warn the source that his or her identity might have to be revealed to the courts if this information is needed to solve or prevent serious criminal conduct.
(b) Broadcasting media shall apply appropriate technical procedures (voice distortion or face blurring) in order to provide secrecy of identity of the person who gives a statement under the condition that he/she remains anonymous.
(c) Documents classified as secret may be reported if after careful consideration it is determined, that the public's need to know outweighs the reasons put forward to justify secrecy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secret service activities</strong></p>
<p>
Secret service activities by journalists and publishers are irreconcilable with the duties stemming from professional secrecy and the prestige of the media. Secret service information must not be brought into connection with the journalist's right to professional secret.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>8. Guidelines for Principle 8</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right to privacy
(a) The journalist should not intrude into and report on a person's private life without his or her consent. The publics right to information must always be weighed against the personal rights of those involved.
(b) Reporting on a person's private life can be justified when it is in the public interest to do so. This would include: detecting or exposing criminal conduct; detecting or exposing seriously anti-social conduct; protecting public health and safety; corruption, etc. Reporting on a person's private life is also justified if it prevents the public from being misled by some statement or action of that individual such as where a person is doing
something in private which he or she is publicly condemning.
(c) Journalists are entitled to probe the private life of someone who is or intends to be public official. It is correctly proceeded where this conduct has a bearing upon his or her suitability for the assignment he/she performs or wants to perform it.
(d) Victims of accidents or crimes have a right to special protection of their names. It is not as a rule necessary to identify the victim in order for the audience better to understand the accident or crime. Exceptions can be justified if the person concerned is a public figure or if there are special accompanying circumstances.
(e) In the case of dependents and other people who are indirectly affected by an accident or who have nothing to do with a crime, care must be taken when publishing names and images.
(f) People's private addresses enjoy special protection.
(g) Physical and mental illness or injuries come fundamentally within the private sphere of the persons affected. Out of consideration for them and their dependents, the media should not publish names and photographs in such cases and should avoid using disparaging terms to describe their illness, even if they are terms in popular usage.
(h) Reporting on suicides calls for restraint. This applies in particular to the publication of names and detailed descriptions of the circumstances. Exceptions are justifiable only if the case is of public interest.
(i) A report is inappropriately sensational if the person it covers is reduced to an object. This is particularly so if reports about a dying or physically or mentally suffering person goes beyond public interest and the readers' requirement for information.
(j) The limit of acceptability in reports on accidents and disasters is respect for the suffering of the victims and the feelings of their dependents. Victims of misfortune must not be made to suffer a second time by their portrayal in the media.
(k) All the above guidelines on the right to privacy apply – where appropriate - also after the death of the person concerned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical research and therapy
(a) Reports of alleged successes or failures of medical or pharmaceutical research in the fight against serious illnesses call for circumspection and a sense of responsibility. Thus, neither text nor presentation should include anything that might raise unfounded hopes of a cure in the near future among ill readers and their dependents if this does not conform to the actual state of medical research. Conversely, critical or even one-sided reports on hotly-debated opinions should not make seriously-ill persons feel unsure and thus raise doubts about the possible success of therapeutic measures.
(b) When reporting on the activities of para-doctors and self-proclaimed healers, a reporter must express a special dose of reasonable doubt and restraint.
(c) In the reports on a spread of contagious and other diseases, a reporter must keep in mind that only a competent state authority is entitled to declare an epidemic.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Court and crime reporting</p>
<p>(a) Reports on investigations and court cases serve to inform the public in a careful way about crimes, their prosecution and court judgment. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court, even if he or she has confessed. Even in cases where guilt is obvious to the public, an accused person cannot be portrayed as guilty within the meaning of a court judgment until a verdict has been handed down.</p>
<p>(b) Prejudicial portrayals and allegations violate the constitutional protection of human dignity, which also applies without qualification to criminals. The aim of court reporting must not be to punish convicted criminals socially as well by using the media as a &quot;pillory&quot;.</p>
<p>(c) Where a media has started reporting a criminal case, it must follow up and report subsequent developments in the case. If the media has reported on an accused, it has named or who is identifiable to a large circle of the audience, it should also report an ensuing acquittal or a marked lessening of charges. This also applies to the dropping of an investigation.</p>
<p>(d) Criticism and comment on a case must be easily distinguishable from reporting on court proceedings.</p>
<p>(e) The media must not identify victims of sexual assaults or publish material likely to contribute to such identification unless the victims have consented or the law has authorized the media to do this.</p>
<p>(f) The media should generally avoid identifying relatives or friends convicted or accused of crime unless the reference to them is necessary for the full, fair and accurate reporting of the crime or the legal proceedings.</p>
<p>(g) When reporting on investigations and criminal court proceedings against young persons and on their appearance in court, the media must exercise especial restraint out of consideration for their future. This also applies to young victims of crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting acts of violence</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In reporting actual and threatened acts of violence, the media should weigh carefully the public's interest in information against the interests of the victims and other people involved. It should report on such incidents in an independent and authentic way, but not allow itself to be made the tool of criminals. Nor should it undertake independent attempts to mediate between criminals and the police. There must be no interviews with perpetrators of violent actions, unless it is necessary for the public interest to cover the event correctly and impartially.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Coordination with the authorities/news 'blackouts'</li>
</ol>
<p>In principle, the media do not accept news 'blackouts'. Coordination between the media and the police shall occur only if the action of journalists can protect or save the life and health of victims and other involved persons. The media shall comply with police requests for a partial or total news embargo for a certain period in the interest of solving crime, if the request is justified convincingly.</p>
<h3>11. Guidelines for principle 11</h3>
<ol>
<li>Invitations and gifts</li>
</ol>
<p>The freedom of decision and independent judgment of publishing companies and their editorial staff is endangered if they accept invitations and gifts which exceed the usual level of social contacts and that necessary in their professional work. Even the appearance that accepting invitations and gifts can impair the freedom of decision of a publishing house and its editorial staff is to be avoided. Therefore, journalists should not accept payments, reimbursement of expenses, discounts, donations, free holidays, business trips, gifts, or any other benefits that might have impact on his work and activities in a way that could cause damage to his professional credibility as well as reputation of the media, for which he works. A journalist shall not accept any benefits without previously obtained approval of editor-in- chief or director of media he works for.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Pressure or influence</li>
</ol>
<p>Journalists must not suppress or distort information about which the public has a right to know because of pressure or influence from their advertisers or others who have a corporate, political or advocacy interest in the media institution concerned.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Separation of functions</li>
</ol>
<p>Should a journalist or publisher exercise another function in addition to his or her journalistic activity, for example in a government, a public authority or a business enterprise, all those involved must take care strictly to separate these functions. The same applies in reverse. Conflicts of interests harm the standing of the media</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>Distinction between editorial content and advertisements</li>
</ol>
<p>Advertisements and pages or programs sponsored must be clearly distinguishable from the editorial content and must be designed and presented that the reader/listener/viewer can recognize them as such. A journalist must not be engaged in advertising-propaganda business.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>Public Relations material</li>
</ol>
<p>The credibility of the media as a source of information calls for particular care in dealing with PR material and in producing editorial supplements. Editorial stories that refer to companies, their products, services or events must not overstep the boundary to hidden advertising. This risk is especially great if a story goes beyond justified public interest or the audience's interest in information. This also applies to unedited advertising texts, photographs and illustrations.</p>
<h3>12. Guidelines for principle 12</h3>
<ol>
<li>Solidarity</li>
</ol>
<p>Journalists should exercise solidarity and protect each other in their rights regardless of political or other beliefs.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Plagiarism</li>
</ol>
<p>No journalist should engage in plagiarism. Plagiarism consists of making use of another person's information, words, ideas and images without proper acknowledgement and attribution of the source. These guidelines are not final, but can be supplemented in compliance with ethic dilemmas arising from practice. Self-regulatory body that will be in charge of observation of Codex of Montenegro Journalists shall be authorized to propose new guidelines or amendment to the existing ones, in the spirit of general ethic norms of the Codex.</p>

"39_NL";"Netherlands";"NL";"Guidelines of the Netherlands press council";"<h1>GUIDELINES OF THE NETHERLANDS PRESS COUNCIL</h1>
<h3>General/Preface</h3>
<p><em>The core task of the Netherlands Press Council is to provide a framework for self-regulation: when and why is journalism prudent and when not?</em></p>
<p>The Council works on the basis of the Guidelines which describe which requirements journalism must meet and as such clarify to all - both inside and outside of the profession - what can be expected of proper journalists and proper journalism.</p>
<hr />
<p>Media plays an extremely important role in our society, in many different ways and on a great many platforms. They monitor authorities and organisations, institutions and businesses. They play an important role in the democratic process in our society. They offer ample room for proper, sound and independent journalistic work in all its manifestations and in all places. This is how the people they work for - the public, in the broadest sense of the work - are served in the best possible way. Proper journalism can only be performed in full freedom and independently. The freedom of the press is vital. This important role comes with obligations and responsibilities. Journalism that demands full freedom is at the same time transparent about its approach and choices. It brings up own conduct and expressions for discussion, thereby building up trust and creating reinforcing effect. Proper journalism is truthful and meticulous, impartial and fair, verifiable and integer and ethical. It allows itself to be inspected and is transparent when handling comments, responses and complaints. Self-regulation is the most effective way of providing a framework for and give substance to this and accepting that responsibility. The Netherlands Press Council is the expression and instrument of that self-regulation. The Council assesses whether and to what extent journalism has been prudent, within the ethics of the profession. It handles complaints about journalistic conduct.[^1]</p>
<p>The departure point of the Guidelines is that anyone engaged in journalism must take responsibilities for the information he or she distributes and the manner in which he or she operates. This is irrespective of the medium in or the platform on which this is done. The media landscape is highly dynamic and will undoubtedly continue to be so; new initiatives are created in the digital world and outside thereof. The journalistic principles and departure points have a power of expression and force of application in every medium and on every platform.</p>
<p>The Council assumes that all journalistic organisations and all journalists recognise, acknowledge and accept the departure points formulated here. The Council invites everyone else engaged in journalism to adopt the Guidelines as departure point.</p>
<p>The assessment of complaints is the main task of the Council. The main objective is to contribute to the continued rise in quality of journalism in the Netherlands in an open and transparent manner.</p>
<p>The Netherlands Press Council is independent in its work and opinion forming.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>In their structure, the Guidelines follow the usual course of events for a journalistic product: from initial selection to, ultimately, publication [^2] and archiving - open and transparent in all steps taken during that course.</em></p>
<p>* This standard can be justifiably departed from in the event of a clear case of malpractice <em>and</em> this is needed to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>A. Departure points</h3>
<p>Journalists report truthfully, verifiably and as completely as possible. They avoid one-sided and biased reporting.</p>
<p>Journalists carry out their work independently and avoid (the appearance of) conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Journalists are free in their choice of what they publish. They weigh the interest of publication against the interests that could be harmed by publication.</p>
<p>Journalists take into account the particular vulnerability of certain groups, such as children (minors) and people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<h3>B. Preparation/Gathering news</h3>
<p><strong>B.1 Journalistic approach</strong></p>
<p>Journalists must introduce themselves to potential discussion partners in their capacity as journalists and be clear to them about their journalist intentions. They also do that when accessing non-public areas. * </p>
<p>Journalists do not abuse their position and refrain from inciting incidents with the intention of creating news.</p>
<p>If journalists want to interview someone, they must inform him or her of the nature of the publication, thereby enabling the interviewee to make an informed decision as to whether he or she wants to cooperate with that publication.</p>
<p>Journalists are free to record telephone conversations without notifying their discussion partner thereof. If they, in the interest of their publication, deem it necessary to partly or fully transmit a recorded telephone conversation, they must notify their discussion partner thereof, prior to publication. *</p>
<p>Working with hidden cameras and microphones or with rolling cameras and active microphones is permitted if required in order to investigate malpractices.</p>
<p><strong>B.2 Sources</strong></p>
<p>In principle, sources are referred to in the publications.</p>
<p>Journalists must protect the identity of sources to whom they have promised confidentiality, and of sources with regard to whom they knew or could have known that they have given them information on the assumption that they would not disclose their identities.</p>
<p>Journalists do not pay witnesses and informers; a reasonable reimbursement of expenses can be acceptable.</p>
<p>Journalists do not steal information, nor will they pay for stolen information. *</p>
<p><strong>B.3 Hearing both sides</strong></p>
<p>Journalists must hear those who are disqualified as a result of a publication, even if their role is marginal. Those who are accused must be given ample opportunity to respond to the accusations, preferably in the same publication. Note that hearing both sides does not relieve journalists from their duty to report as truthfully as possible.</p>
<p>The principle of hearing both sides does not apply to publications which seem to contain a personal opinion (e.g. columns, reviews and opinion contributions) and reports of a factual nature, such as reports of public meetings.</p>
<p><strong>B.4 Agreements</strong></p>
<p>A journalist who accepts an embargo request must comply with the agreement until the agreed term has expired. The embargo is lifted if the information provided under the embargo is published in a different medium, or the person who requested the embargo has lifted it prematurely or fails to comply with the agreements made.</p>
<p>Journalists who give the subject of the article the opportunity to inspect the article in advance - in order to correct factual misstatements and remove any lack of clarity - are free to decide how to incorporate comments in the article.</p>
<h3>C. Publication</h3>
<p>
In their publications, journalists must make a clear distinction between facts, allegations and opinions.
</p>
<p>
Columnists, cartoonists and reviewers are free to express their opinions on events and persons. 
</p>
<p>Stylistic tools such as exaggeration and deliberate one-sidedness are permitted.</p>
<p>Publications only state the ethnic origins, nationality, race, religion and sexual inclination of groups and persons if deemed required for a proper comprehension of the facts and circumstances that are reported on. </p>
<p>Accusations are only published subject to a proper investigation to establish whether there is a sound basis, certainly so if these accusations are expressed by persons who are in conflict with the accused or who are otherwise affected.</p>
<p>Quotes from interviews may not be used in a context other than can be expected by the interviewee, with a view to what he has been notified of by the journalist. The interviewee must again be asked for his permission to his statements being published, if in the course of the editorial process the nature or content of a publication has changed to the extent that it no longer meets his reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Journalists who in their publications link to information of third parties need to consider whether the interest served by including a (hyper)link in the publication is in reasonable proportion to the interests that are potentially damaged as a result thereof.</p>
<p>Visual material may not be used by way of illustration in a subject or context other than for which the photographic evidence or footage was made, unless it is clarified why the visual material was used.</p>
<p>Image manipulations may not be misleading. The reader and viewer must be made aware of anything that causes an obvious change to the image.</p>
<p><strong>C.1 Privacy</strong></p>
<p>A publication must not infringe the privacy of persons any more than is reasonably required within the framework of the report. An intrusion of privacy would be imprudent if not in reasonable proportion to the social interest of the publication.</p>
<p>Public figures must accept a certain degree of exposure to unwanted publicity. In their private surroundings, they too have the right to privacy, unless their conduct in their private lives demonstrably affects their public performance.</p>
<p>Journalists must refrain from publishing pictures and broadcasting images of persons in generally non-public areas without their permission, or using letters and personal notes without the permission from those involved. *</p>
<p>Journalists must refrain from bothering, persistently following or tailing persons for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>Journalists must prevent information or images from being published as a result of which suspects and convicted persons can be easily identified and traced by the public at large. Journalists are not obliged to observe this rule if the name forms a vital part of the report, if omission of the name on account of the general reputation of the person involved does not serve any purpose, if omission of the name can cause confusion with others who can be expected to be harmed as a result of that, if the name is mentioned within the framework of issuing appeals or if the person involved goes public him or herself.</p>
<p>Publications on serious offences must omit any details of the offence if they are expected to add suffering to the victim or his or her immediate family and if they are not needed to demonstrate the nature and gravity of the offence or the consequences thereof. When approaching the casualties of accidents and disasters and their next of kin, journalists should make allowance for the right of those involved to be left alone. Journalists must act reservedly if the defencelessness or mental state of those involved gives rise to that.</p>
<h3>D. Accountability/In retrospect</h3>
<p>The editorial office is responsible for publishing letters and responses received on the website of the medium involved.</p>
<p>It is preferred that the editorial office publish the terms and conditions for selection and publication of responses.</p>
<p>The editorial office is free to decide against publishing letters and responses received or to add a postscript to them, unless publication has been promised. Changes and deletions are permitted, as long as the essence and composition are maintained. If the editorial office decides to publish, the period between submission and publication of the response must not exceed the sender's reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Before the editorial office decides to publish a response that contains a serious allegation, they must verify whether the allegation has a sound basis. The accused must also be given the opportunity to tell his side of the story.</p>
<p>It cannot be expected that all responses are moderated and possibly removed in advance. The editorial office can decide though to remove any responses that have been published. If a response contains a serious accusation or an offensive remark aimed at individuals, the editorial office, on the request of the person(s) involved, must investigate whether there are actual grounds for the accusation or allegation and, if there is not, remove the response.</p>
<p>If journalists are requested to anonymize archived articles or to remove these, then in exceptional cases only will they allow for the public interest of archives of the highest level of completeness and reliability to be outweighed by the private interests of those who make the request.</p>
<p>If it appears that a publication contains misstatements or imputably incomplete, journalists must rectify this appropriately and as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p><em>The Guidelines of the Netherlands Press Council were adopted by its members in April 2007 and amended in April 2008, September 2010, May 2015, June 2018 and December 2019.</em></p>
<p>[^1]: Journalistic conduct is taken to mean: an act or omission by a journalist in the course of his profession or an act or omission within the framework of journalistic activities by someone other than a journalist who regularly and against payment contributes to the editorial content of publicity media (see Section 4 of the Articles of Association).
[^2]: Publication is taken to mean: each form of communication, such as an article, transmission or Twitter message, within the framework of journalistic conduct.</p>

"
"40_NO";"Norway";"NO";"Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press";"<h1>Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press</h1>
<p>Ethical Code of Practice for the Press (printed press, radio, television and net publications).</p>
<p>Adopted by the Norwegian Press Association June 13. 2015.</p>
<p>Each editor and editorial staff member is required to be familiar with these ethical standards of the press, and to base their practice on this code. The ethical practice comprehends the complete journalistic process from research to publication.</p>
<h3>1. The Role of the Press in Society</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Information and Freedom of the Press are basic elements of a democracy. A free, independent press is among the most important institutions in a democratic society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The press has important functions in that it carries information, debates and critical comments on current affairs. The press is particularly responsible for allowing different views to be expressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The press shall protect the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the principle of access to official documents. It cannot yield to any pressure from anybody who might want to prevent open debates, the free flow of information and free access to sources. Agreements concerning exclusive event reporting shall not preclude independent news reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the right of the press to carry information on what goes on in society and to uncover and disclose matters, which ought to be subjected to criticism. It is a press obligation to shed critical light on how media themselves exercise their role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the task of the press to protect individuals and groups against injustices or neglect, committed by public authorities and institutions, private enterprises, or others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Integrity and credibility</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The responsible editor carries personal and full responsibility for the contents of the media and has the final decision in any questions regarding editorial content, financing, presentation and publication. The editor shall act freely and independently towards any persons or groups who for ideological, economic or other reasons might want to exercise an influence over the editorial content. The editor shall safeguard the editorial staff production of free and independent journalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The editor and the individual editorial staff member must protect their independence, integrity and credibility. Avoid dual roles, positions, commissions or commitments that create conflicts of interest connected to or leading to speculations of disqualification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open on matters that could be relevant for how the public perceive the journalistic content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the editorial staff must not exploit their position in order to achieve personal gain, including receiving money, goods or services, that can be perceived as compensation from outsiders for editorial benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A member of the editorial staff cannot be ordered to do anything that is contrary to his or her convictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never undermine the clear distinction between editorial copy and advertisements. It must be obvious to the public what is deemed to be commercial content. The distinction must be obvious also when using web links and other connective means. Decline any commercial content that can be confused with the individual medium journalistic presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Editorial mention of products, services, brand names and commercial interests, including the media own, must be motivated by editorial considerations and must not appear as an advertisement. Maintain an obvious distinction between marketing activities and editorial work. Turn down any offers of journalistic favours in return for advertisements. Avoid indiscriminate reproduction of PR material.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hidden advertising is incompatible with good press practice. Commercial interests must not influence journalistic activities, content or presentation. If the editorial material is sponsored, or a programme has product placements, this must be obvious to the public. Sponsorship must always be clearly marked. Sponsorship or product placement in news or current affairs journalism or journalism directed at children is incompatible with good press practice. Direct expenses for journalistic activities must in the main be paid by the editorial department itself. In the event of an exception, the audience must be made aware of what is financed by external interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the editorial staff must not accept assignments from anyone other than editorial management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Journalistic Conduct and Relations with the Sources</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The source of information must, as a rule, be identified, unless this conflicts with source protection or consideration for a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be critical in the choice of sources, and make sure that the information provided is correct. It is good press practice to aim for diversity and relevance in the choice of sources. If anonymous sources are used, or the publication is offered exclusivity, especially stringent requirements must be imposed on the critical evaluation of the sources. Particular caution should be exercised when dealing with information from anonymous sources, information from sources offering exclusivity, and information provided from sources in return for payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good press conduct requires clarification of the terms on which an interview is being carried out. This also pertains to adjacent research. Any agreement regarding quote check should be made in advance of the interview, and it should be made clear what the agreement includes and what deadlines apply. The editors decide for themselves what should finally be published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the sources of the press. The protection of sources is a basic principle in a free society and is a prerequisite for the ability of the press to fulfil its duties towards society and ensure the access to essential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not divulge the name of a person who has provided information on a confidential basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consideration of the sources and the independence of the press, unpublished material as a main rule should not be divulged to third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the duty of the press to report the intended meaning in quotes from an interview. Direct quotes must be accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes of a given statement should be limited to corrections of factual errors. No one without editorial authority may intervene in the editing or presentation of editorial material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceed tactfully in journalistic research. In particular show consideration for people who cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have. Never abuse the emotions or feelings of other people, their ignorance or their lack of judgment. Remember that people in shock or grief are more vulnerable than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hidden cameras/microphones or false identity may only be used under special circumstances. The condition must be that such a method is the only possible way to uncover cases of essential importance to society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The press shall as a rule not pay sources or interviewees for information. Exercise moderation when paying a consideration for news tips. It is incompatible with good press practice to employ payment schemes designed to tempt people, without due cause, to invade the privacy of others or to disclose sensitive personal information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Publication Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a point of fairness and thoughtfulness in contents and presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make plain what is factual information and what is comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always respect a person character and identity, privacy, ethnicity, nationality and belief..Be careful when using terms that create stigmas. Never draw attention to personal or private aspects if they are irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that headlines, introductions and leads do not go beyond what is being related in the text. It is considered good press conduct to reveal your source when the information is quoted from other media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular avoid presumption of guilt in crime and court reporting. Make it evident that the question of guilt, whether relating to somebody under suspicion, reported, accused or charged, has not been decided until the sentence has legal efficacy. It is a part of good press conduct to report the final result of court proceedings, which have been reported earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always consider how reports on accidents and crime may affect the victims and next-ofkin. Do not identify victims or missing persons unless next-of-kin have been informed. Show consideration towards people in grief or at times of shock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be cautious in the use of names and photographs and other clear identifiers of persons in referring to contentious or punishable matters. Special caution should be exercised when reporting cases at the early stage of investigation, cases concerning young offenders and cases in which an identifying report may place an unreasonable burden on a third party. Identification must be founded on a legitimate need for information. It may, for instance, be legitimate to identify someone where there is imminent danger of assault on defenceless individuals, in the case of serious and repeated crimes, if the identity or social position of the subject is patently relevant to the case being reported on, or where identification protects the innocent from exposure to unjustified suspicion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting on children, it is considered good press conduct to assess the implications that media focusing could cause in each case. This also pertains when the person in charge or parent, has agreed to exposure. As a general rule the identity of children should not be disclosed in reports on family disputes or cases under consideration by the childcare authorities or by the courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be cautious when reporting on suicide and attempted suicide. Avoid reporting that is not necessary for meeting a general need for information. Avoid description of methods or other matters that may contribute to provoking further suicidal actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise caution when using photos in any other context than the original.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the credibility of the journalistic photograph. Photos used as documentation must not be altered in a way that creates a false impression. Manipulated photos can only be accepted as illustrations if it is evident that it in actual fact is a picture collage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of pictures must comply with the same requirements of caution as for a written or oral presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorrect information must be corrected and, when called for, an apology given, as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who have been subjected to strong accusations shall, if possible, have the opportunity to simultaneous reply as regards factual information. Debates, criticism and dissemination of news must not be hampered by parties being unwilling to make comments or take part in the debate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who have been the subject of an attack shall have the chance to reply at the earliest opportunity, unless the attack and criticism are part of a running exchange of views. Any reply should be of reasonable length, be pertinent to the matter and seemly in its form. The reply can be refused if the party in question has rejected, without an objective reason, an offer of presenting a contemporaneous rejoinder on the same issue. Replies and contributions to the debate should not be accompanied by polemic editorial comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that digital publication pointers and links could bring you to other electronic media that do not comply with the Ethical Code. See to it that links to other media or publications are clearly marked. It is considered good press conduct to inform the users of interactive services on how the publication registers you, and possibly exploits your use of the services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the editorial staff choose not to pre-edit digital chatting, this has to be announced in a clear manner for those accessing the pages. The editorial staff has a particular responsibility, instantly to remove inserts that are not in compliance with the Ethical Code.</p>

### Scope

The Media Council scope applies to published material in newspapers, magazines and their websites, including audio and video streams, as well as to digital sites with news content, or blogs characterised by their new commentary.

Coverage also extends to the online content of the following broadcasters - TVNZ, MediaWorks, Sky Network Television, Maori Television, NZME Radio and Radio New Zealand.

The Council retains the discretion to decline a complaint if the publication has limited readership or the circumstances make the complaint inappropriate for resolution by the Council.

The Council adjudications are based on ethical considerations: it does not recover debts or seek monetary recompense for complainants. Its Principles and Complaints Procedures are set out below.

### Preamble

The main objective of the New Zealand Media Council, established as an industry self-regulatory body in 1972, is to provide the public with an independent forum for resolving complaints involving the newspapers, magazines and the websites of such publications and other digital media. The Council is also concerned with promoting media freedom and maintaining the press in accordance with the highest professional standards.

An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy. The proper fulfilment of that role requires a fundamental responsibility to maintain high standards of accuracy, fairness and balance and public faith in those standards.
There is no more important principle in a democracy than freedom of expression. Freedom of expression 

and freedom of the media are inextricably bound. The print media is jealous in guarding freedom of expression, not just for publishers' sake but, more importantly, in the public interest. In dealing with complaints, the Council will give primary consideration to freedom of expression and the public interest.
Public interest is defined as involving a matter capable of affecting the people at large so that they might be legitimately interested in, or concerned about, what is going on, or what may happen to them or to others.
Distinctions between fact, on the one hand, and conjecture, opinion or comment, on the other hand, must be maintained. This does not prevent rigorous analysis. Nor does it interfere with a publication right to adopt a forthright stance or to advocate on any issue. Further, the Council acknowledges that the genre or purpose of a publication or article, for example blogs, satire, cartoons or gossip, call for special consideration in any complaint.

The Media Council endorses the principles and spirit of the Treaty of Waitangi and Bill of Rights Act, without sacrificing the imperative of publishing news and reports that are in the public interest.

Editors have the ultimate responsibility for what appears in their publications, and for adherence to the standards of ethical journalism which the Council upholds. In dealing with complaints, the Council seeks the co-operation of editors and publishers. News bloggers and digital media are similarly required to participate responsibly.

The following principles may be used by complainants when they wish to point the Council to the core of their complaint. However, a complainant may nominate other ethical grounds for consideration.

### Principles

**1. Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**

  Publications should be bound at all times by accuracy, fairness and balance, and should not deliberately mislead or misinform readers by commission or omission. In articles of controversy or disagreement, a fair voice must be given to the opposition view. 

  Exceptions may apply for long-running issues where every side of an issue or argument cannot reasonably be repeated on every occasion and in reportage of proceedings where balance is to be judged on a number of stories, rather than a single report. 
  

**2. Privacy**

  Everyone is normally entitled to privacy of person, space and personal information, and these rights should be respected by publications. Nevertheless the right of privacy should not interfere with publication of significant matters of public record or public interest. 

  Publications should exercise particular care and discretion before identifying relatives of persons convicted or accused of crime where the reference to them is not relevant to the matter reported. 
  Those suffering from trauma or grief call for special consideration. 

**3. Children and Young People**
 
  In cases involving children and young people editors must demonstrate an exceptional degree of public interest to override the interests of the child or young person. 

**4. Comment and Fact**

  A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion. An article that is essentially comment or opinion should be clearly presented as such. Material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate. 

**5. Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**

  Opinion, whether newspaper column or internet blog, must be clearly identified as such unless a column, blog or other expression of opinion is widely understood to consist largely of the writer own opinions. Though requirements for a foundation of fact pertain, with comment and opinion balance is not essential. Cartoons are understood to be opinion. 

  Letters for publication are the prerogative of editors who are to be guided by fairness, balance, and public interest. Abridgement is acceptable but should not distort meaning. 
  

**6. Headlines and Captions**

  Headlines, sub-headings, and captions should accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report they are designed to cover. 

**7. Discrimination and Diversity**

  Issues of gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, colour or physical or mental disability are legitimate subjects for discussion where they are relevant and in the public interest, and publications may report and express opinions in these areas. Publications should not, however, place gratuitous emphasis on any such category in their reporting. 

**8. Confidentiality**

  Publications have a strong obligation to protect against disclosure of the identity of confidential sources. They also have a duty to take reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that such sources are well informed and that the information they provide is reliable. Care should be taken to ensure both source and publication agrees over what has been meant by ""off-the-record"". 

**9. Subterfuge**

  Information or news obtained by subterfuge, misrepresentation or dishonest means is not permitted unless there is an overriding public interest and the news or information cannot be obtained by any other means. 

**10. Conflicts of Interest**

  To fulfil their proper watchdog role, publications must be independent and free of obligations to their news sources. They should avoid any situations that might compromise such independence. Where a story is enabled by sponsorship, gift or financial inducement, that sponsorship, gift or financial inducement should be declared. 

Where an author link to a subject is deemed to be justified, the relationship of author to subject should be declared. 
  

**11. Photographs and Graphics**

Editors should take care in photographic and image selection and treatment. Any technical manipulation that could mislead readers should be noted and explained. 
Photographs showing distressing or shocking situations should be handled with special consideration for those affected 

**12. Corrections**

A publication willingness to correct errors enhances its credibility and, often, defuses complaint. Significant errors should be promptly corrected with fair prominence. In some circumstances it will be appropriate to offer an apology and a right of reply to an affected person or persons. "
"42_PL";"Poland";"PL";"Code of Ethics of the Association of Polish Journalists";"# Code of Ethics of the Association of Polish Journalists

By adopting the principles of the Media Ethics Charter and the declaration of the International Federation of Journalists, we recognize that:

- a journalist is to provide reliable and impartial information, various opinions, and to enable participation in public debate,

- freedom of speech and expression must be accompanied by being responsible for publications in the press, radio, television, and the Internet,

- the interests of the readers, listeners, and viewers as well as the public good should take precedence over the interests of the author, editor, publisher, or broadcaster.


### I - Information and opinions

1. Information should be clearly distinguished from interpretations and opinions.

2. Information should be balanced and accurate so that the recipient can distinguish facts from assumptions and rumours, and should be presented in an appropriate context, and based on credible and possibly multilateral sources.

3. Opinions may be biased, but they must not distort the facts and be the result of external pressures.

4. Errors and mistakes require immediate rectification, even if they were not the fault of the author or the editors and regardless of whether anyone applied for rectification.


### II - Collection and processing of materials

5. When collecting materials, illegal and ethically reprehensible methods must not be used; hidden cameras and microphones or telephone wiretapping are permissible only in the case of investigative journalism, i.e. tracking of crimes, corruption, or abuse of power, on behalf of the public good and with the knowledge and consent of the journalist's superiors.

6. The private and intimate sphere must not be violated; in justified circumstances, an exception can include activities in the field of investigative journalism, and also for public figures.

7. A journalist is obliged to keep secret the source of their information, including the person and image of the informant if required by the informant with the reservation that the secret may be disclosed only to the journalist's supervisor.

8. The elaboration or summary of information, interviews or opinions must not change their meaning and pronunciation; archival materials and reconstructions of events presented in electronic media should be appropriately marked.


### III – Journalists' interactions with interviewees and recipients of journalists' work

9. Interviewees should be informed about the use of their statements; permission is required from the interviewee if the interviewee restricts the use of their statements; children's statements may only be used with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.

10. A journalist should show respect for people, regardless of their ideological, cultural, or moral differences which do not comply with the journalist's own views.

11. Consideration must be exercised to not offend people with physical or mental disabilities, the old and the sick, and those who are helpless in life.

12. Particular care should be taken when informing about new methods of treatment that have not yet been fully tested and are only experimental in nature; fortune-telling and horoscopes cannot be presented as reliable information or indicators.

13. The language of speech should be careful, while vulgarisms and obscene terms should be avoided.


### IV - Offences and exceptional situations

14. When disclosing crimes and persons suspected of having committed crimes, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid descriptions that allow for initiation of anti-social acts, and not presume guilt until the court issues a final judgment.

15. When reporting on wars, riots and demonstrations, journalists should maintain an attitude of uninvolved observers, so as not to be manipulated.

16. It is unacceptable to show scenes of death in close-up, and the bloody effects of wars and catastrophes; manifestations of cruelty and violence can be described and shown only on condition of maintaining a balance between the accuracy of the reporting and the sensitivity of the audience's feelings, especially victims' families and their relatives.


### V - Conflicts of interest

17. Journalistic credibility and independence are incompatible with accepting gifts worth more than PLN 200, free trips, or items and devices for testing.

18. A journalist cannot be involved in canvassing or participate in advertising and public relations; the only exception is social and charity campaigns; editorial materials must be clearly separated from advertising and promotional materials.

19. Surreptitious advertising and withholding of information are highly reprehensible.

20. A journalist may not use publicly disclosed information obtained in the course of their professional activity for their own interest, especially in financial and economic journalism.

21. The involvement of journalists in direct political and party activity is also a manifestation of a conflict of interest, and the taking up of such activities and performance of functions in public administration and political organizations is not permitted.


### VI - Colleagues and Superiors

22. Relations between colleagues and associates should be based on partnership. Unfair competition and misappropriation of other people's work or even ideas are unacceptable.

23. The journalist is loyal to his supervisors and publishers or broadcasters. However, they cannot order the journalist, and the journalist has the right to refuse, to carry out orders contrary to the law, their professional ethics, or well-established convictions.


### VII - Liability and penalties

24. The author of the press, radio, television or Internet publication as well as their editor, publisher or broadcaster are all liable for violations of the principles of journalistic ethics.

25. Penalties are imposed by journalistic courts, depending on the nature and scale of the offence, including: admonitions, reprimands, temporary suspensions of rights as a member of the Association of Polish Journalists, and removal from the Association. The Supreme Journalists Court can announce such verdicts in the media."
"43_PT";"Portugal";"PT";"Union of Journalists' Code of Ethics";" # Union of Journalists' Code of Ethics

Text contains news, after the changes approved at the 4th Congress of Journalists, in January, and confirmed in the referendum of October 26, 27 and 28, 2017.
1. A journalist has a duty to report the facts with accuracy and to interpret them honestly. The facts should be checked by hearing the parties with notable interests in the case. The distinction between news and opinion must be made very clear in the eyes of the public.
2. A journalist has to fight censorship and sensationalism and to consider accusations without proof and plagiarism as serious professional mistakes.
3. A journalist has to fight against restrictions in the access to information sources, and against attempts to limit the freedom of expression and the right to inform. It is the obligation of a journalist to publicise any violations of those rights.
4. A journalist has to use legal means in obtaining information, pictures or documents, and must avoid abusing anyone's trust. The identification of oneself as a journalist is a rule, the breaking of which is permissible only on the grounds of an unquestionable public interest and after verifying the impossibility of obtaining relevant information through normal processes.
5. A journalist has to carry responsibility of all their work and professional acts, and they must correct information that proved to be false or inexact. 
6. A journalist has to refuse acts/behaviour that violate their conscience.
7. Identification of one's sources is an essential must for a journalist. They must not reveal, not even in court, their confidential sources except when they have been deceived by false information. Opinions must always be attributed.
8. A journalist has to respect the presumption of innocence until a case is finished. A journalist must not identify, directly or indirectly, victims or offenders of sexual crimes. Journalists must not identify minors, indirectly or directly, whether they be sources, witnesses of news events, witnesses of newsworthy events, victims, or perpetrators of acts that the law qualifies as a crime. Journalists must not cause people humiliation or disturb their sorrow.
9. A journalist must not treat people in a discriminatory way, based on their heritage, colour, ethnicity, language, place of origin, religion, political or ideological viewpoints, education, economic situation, social status, age, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. 
10. A journalist has to respect the private life of citizens except when the public interest demands revelation or when the behaviour of the person in question is contradictory to the values and principles that they publicly defend. Before collecting statements and images, the journalist should ensure that the conditions of serenity, freedom, dignity, and responsibility of the people involved are met.
11. A journalist must reject requests, functions, and benefits that could jeopardise his/her independent status and professional integrity. A journalist must not use his professional status in order to get personal benefits."

<p><em>The journalists' Code of Ethics, established by the Convention of Media Organizations</em></p>
<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>This Code of Ethics has been established by member organisations in the Convention of Media Organisations. The provisions of the Code of Ethics are freely consented upon by the journalists and members of the professional, patronage, and trade union organisation signatories of the Journalist Statute adopted by the Convention of Media Organisations in Sinaia between the 9th and the 11th of July 2004. The enforcement of the provisions set forth by the Code of Ethics shall be ensured by the specialised bodies of each organisation signatory of the Journalist Statute. Under this Code, the notion of public interest will be understood as arising from the following premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any matter that affects the life of the community is of public interest. This is not limited to political matters but includes any other circumstances of interest to the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public interest does not refer only to the matters considered as such by the authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The manner in which the government, authorities, or public institutions function and act, as well as any other entity that uses public funds or that affects the interest of the community is of major public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All actions, omissions, gestures, and words of dignitaries, politicians, and all civil servants related to the exercise of their function as such are of major public interest. Their private lives are of public interest when they are relevant to the exercise of their respective function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the contribution of the authorities to the management of power and public services, any critique brought against them is of major public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is no clear public interest at stake, freedom of speech can only be limited for the protection of another fundamental right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any information concerning human rights violations - as defined in the international documents ratified by Romania - is of major public interest.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>THE ROLE OF THE JOURNALIST</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to exercise the uninfringeable right of free speech based on the public's right to be informed. The journalist enjoys enhanced protection while exercising that uninfringeable right, as the journalist is participating in the vital role of protector of democratic values, which the press holds within society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to look for, respect, and communicate the facts – as they become known through reasonable research – based on the public's right to be informed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to express opinions based on facts. In reporting the facts and opinions, the journalist shall act in good faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility of signalling negligence, injustice, and abuse of any kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the journalist's effort to inform the public, the journalist's job is to reflect society as a whole and to reflect its diversity by including minority and individual opinions. The public has the right to know not only the information and ideas that would be received favourably or indifferently or would be considered harmless, but also those that would offend, shock or disturb. These are the requirements of pluralism, tolerance, and open mindedness, without which no democratic society can exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist profession entails certain rights, obligations, freedoms, and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>
<p><strong>1. Respecting human rights</strong></p>
<p>In exercising its role as guarantor of democracy, the primary duty of the press is to respect human rights. Thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to respect the presumption of innocence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to respect the private life of the individual (including those aspects that regard family, residence, and correspondence). Interference in a person's private life to obtain information is permitted only when the public interest in learning that information prevails. In this context, it is irrelevant whether a public person wanted to acquire that status. An activity is not private merely on the grounds that it is not carried out in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility to bear in mind the legitimate interest of the minor. The journalist shall protect the identity of minors involved in crimes, whether as victims or perpetrators, unless the public interest requires that they be identified in order to protect the best interests of the minor, or at the express request of the parents or legal representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identities of victims of accidents, disasters, crime, and especially sexual assault should not be disclosed unless the victims have given their consent, or when a major public interest prevails. This also applies to vulnerable persons such as the sick, disabled, refugees, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the responsibility not to discriminate against any person on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, age, sexual orientation, or disability, and should refrain from any instigation potentially leading to hatred and violence while attempting to state the facts or express opinions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. The rules of editing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Factual or otherwise verified information must be clearly separated from opinions. The journalist shall make reasonable efforts in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist shall reasonably verify the information before publishing it and shall express opinions based on facts. Blatantly untrue information, or information that the journalist has good reason to believe is false, shall not be published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reporting about a matter, the journalist must endeavour to present the views of all parties involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While editing, the journalist shall respect the rules of quoting. If they partially quote someone, the journalist has the obligation not to alter that person's message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. The protection of sources</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The journalist has the responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of those sources who request to remain anonymous, or of those sources whose life, physical or mental integrity, or workplace could be in jeopardy if their identities were revealed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Gathering of information</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The journalist shall obtain information in an open and transparent manner. The use of special investigative techniques is justified when obtaining that information would serve the public interest and when information cannot be obtained by any other means. It is recommended that the use of special investigation techniques be explicitly mentioned when publishing the respective information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Abuse of status</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using journalistic status for personal gain or in order to favour a third party constitutes a serious violation of ethical standards and is thus unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist shall not accept gifts in cash or in any other form, or any other benefits offered to them regarding their professional status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist shall avoid conflicts of interest. It is recommended that the journalist separate editorial activities from political and economic ones.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. Independence</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The journalist shall exercise the journalist profession according to the journalist's own conscience and in accordance with the principles provided by the Journalist's Statute and this Code of Ethics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7. Correcting errors; the right to reply</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The journalist will promptly correct any error that has appeared in the journalist's materials. Where the journalist deems necessary, the journalist may also publish an apology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to reply is granted when the request is considered justified and reasonable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>THE JOURNALIST'S RIGHTS</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The journalist is protected by the international treaties and conventions to which Romania is a party and which guarantee freedom of speech and free access to information as well as all sources of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist has the right to oppose censorship of any kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protection of professional secrecy and of confidential sources is both a right and an obligation of the journalist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The journalist has the right to invoke the conscience clause. The journalist has the right to refuse any journalistic action the journalist deems being against the principles of journalistic ethics or the journalist's own beliefs. This freedom derives from the journalist's obligation to inform the public in good faith.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By virtue of the good practice of separating economic activities from editorial ones, the journalist has the right to refuse to obtain advertising or sponsorship contracts for the press institution the journalist works for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist enjoys, according to the law, the protection of copyright privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journalist affirms the right to be defended by the press institution where the journalist exercises the journalist profession, as well as by the professional or trade union association that represents the journalist's interests regarding any pressure exerted against the journalist, i.e., pressure that can lead to a breach of professional conduct as set forth by the Journalist's Statute and this Code of Ethics.</p>

<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>By adopting this <strong>Standard of Media Ethics</strong>, the Russian mass media self-regulatory body:</p>
<ul>
<li> assumes that each resolution taken by the Public Collegium for Information Dispute within the scope of its statutory powers should be fully and accurately developed following the journalism basic principles, standards and rules of conduct;</li>
<li> takes into account that Russia lacks national professional and ethical regulations, whether binding or designed to be used by journalists as guidelines, i.e. helping to confidently distinguish between the materials that are prescribed, approved or recommended in journalism from those regarded as disputable or unacceptable because of the ethical restrictions or express prohibitions set and supported by journalist communities;</li>
<li> recognises that it is fundamentally impossible to develop reference professional and ethical regulations (a global or European 'journalism code of conduct') or a universal journalism standard suitable for work in any conditions, including in countries which lack well-established values, including the value of the importance of journalism;</li>
<li> believes that, although 'universal' regulations cannot reasonably exist, this cannot prevent the development of strong professional values, standards and rules of conduct, or guidelines based on both the best international journalism practices and the expertise of high-quality Russian media;</li>
<li> takes into account the shortcomings and errors in a number of regulations designed and adopted in Russia decades ago as binding upon members of a specific professional association ( Russian Journalist Code of Professional Ethics , 1994) or a specific group of media organisations ( Television and Radio Broadcasting Charter , 1999);</li>
<li> notes that the fundamental changes in the journalistic situation caused by the emergence of new media and the migration of great amounts of mass media content to social media have raised and clarified the public demand for learning how to distinguish between bloggers and professional journalists :</li>
<li>definitely setting stricter requirements to the professional aspect of journalist work; to start with clarification and revisiting of the professional ethics concepts by Russian journalists;</li>
<li> takes advantage of its successful two-year practical work on the draft of the Standard of Media Ethics and the use of this draft as working reference regulations by both the regional Collegia for Press Complaints and the Association  of Independent Regional Publishers (AIRP) .</li>
</ul>
<p>By adopting this Standard of Media Ethics as a working guideline to be used by it in addressing specific complaints, the Collegium believes that following particular journalists' and media outlets' principles,  standards and rules of conduct set out as the 'Collegium's Standard' (guaranteed to be consistent with the international concepts of journalism) will help to considerably reduce the risk of information disputes, improve the environment for press freedom and mass media credibility, and meet the interests of both Russians and Russian society in general.</p>
<p>The Collegium would like to emphasise that this Standard of Media Ethics neither supersedes or replaces any codes of journalist unions (associations) or any of the media organisation (media outlet) codes and/or their equivalents, nor creates any barriers or obstacles to enforcement thereof by members of media associations or any specific media organisation personnel.</p>
<p>The Collegium hopes that editorial staff, editors-in-chief and media owners will show professional and critical interest in this Standard of Media Ethics .</p>
<h3>Principle 1. Enforcement of the right to information</h3>
<p>Both the nation and each individual member of the nation have the right to reliable, accurate, complete and impartial information which promotes the formation of a realistic picture of the world in any user of journalist products.</p>
<p>Each person has the right to express their various opinions by using the media as tools of mass communication, civic education and cultural exchange.</p>
<p>A journalist must take every reasonable step to facilitate access to the media for the public and individuals who wish to contribute to the formation of a largely specific civic information and opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> realistic picture of the world; the right of individuals to express their opinions in the media is enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>Each journalist should take professional interest in the opinions of all the parties concerned as well as reflect these opinions in their publications.</p>
<p>Civic content (information from persons carrying out information work on their own initiative, bloggers) should be clearly differentiated from the content prepared by professional journalists and editorial staff.</p>
<h3>Principle 2. Professional and social responsibility in journalism</h3>
<p>Journalist work is to serve the community; in journalism, information is to be primarily understood as the common good. The latter means that each journalist is professionally responsible for the provision of true information both to certain social groups, which represent various public interests reflected by the media, and to society in general.</p>
<p>In journalism, professional and social responsibility means that in any situation and under any circumstances (except for emergencies where all the parties involved, whether due to the situation or by force of duty, should act in a particular manner), each journalist should follow their conscience, the fundamental norms and principles of professional ethics as well as the applicable occupational standards.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> professional responsibility is recognised; professional standards are readily followed; journalism is distinguished from everything which is not journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>Professional journalists are not allowed to act (under the guise of or without disclosing their professional status) as public relations specialists or advertising experts or carry out stealth marketing, even if instructed to do so by their employer.</p>
<p>Journalism is incompatible with any form of involvement in the work of special services.</p>
<p>Journalism must not be part of any cyberwar, misuse of information or mind games targeted at media users.</p>
<h3>Principle 3. Each journalist must make true and honest reports</h3>
<p>A journalist should, in the first place, enforce the right of people to true, accurate and complete information about the facts and current events. Each journalist is personally responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information on facts, and for honest, diligent and unbiased coverage of current events so that the information about those facts and events makes sense for individuals, social groups and society in general.</p>
<p>Journalists and editorial staff of the media must take reasonable care to avoid publishing inaccurate, misleading or corrupted information, including text and images used as visual explanation thereof.</p>
<p>Respect to society and their own profession means that journalists should respect the right of people to reply.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> neutrality; unbiased approach and position; information is verified; the right to reply is respected.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>Neither the editorial team nor a journalist is obliged to be neutral when referring to a conflict situation; both the editorial team and a journalist are free to take the position they think is correct, fair and consistent with their personal preferences and/or public demands. However, it is assumed that a journalist's honest name and reputation is at stake, so they must accurately select and present facts and report opinions as well as make a clear distinction between facts and comments/assumptions. Bias and prejudice are inappropriate in honest journalism, and any of their signs should be expelled by the journalist in cooperation with the editor.</p>
<p>The Collegium assumes that an honest journalist should:</p>
<ul>
<li> collect information by only using honest approaches and methods;</li>
<li>make a clear distinction between news (news information) and opinions/comments in a way understandable for readers;</li>
<li>only disseminate as informational the reports he/she reasonably believes to be accurate because they have been duly verified by the use of the verification tools available to the journalist and the media;</li>
<li>highlight and separate from accurate information by using specific professional methods (adequate marking) any rumours and data which could not have been verified for reasons beyond the control of the journalist or editorial team; the attempted verification should also be mentioned;</li>
<li>make a distinction between archival information and news , between documentary photos, films, video/audio content and any materials prepared by the use of the editing techniques which can create an impression that it is documentary content ;</li>
<li>specify the sources of information whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Collegium believes that any editorial office which values the honest names and professional reputation of its journalists should meet the reasonable request of any individual and organisation for exercising their right to reply to inaccurate publications.</p>
<h3>Principle 4. Professional integrity in journalism</h3>
<p>Professional integrity means that a journalist has the responsibility and the right to freely and without fear of retaliation refuse to perform the tasks that are contrary to their principles and beliefs.</p>
<p>Professional integrity means that a journalist must keep confidential the source of information which was provided on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Professional integrity means that a journalist may not represent private or corporate interests that conflict with the common good (public interest).</p>
<p>Professional integrity means respecting others' intellectual property rights unconditionally, including, but not limited to, avoiding any form of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Professional integrity is demonstrated in the readiness to admit and correct a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> freedom of and responsibility for a moral choice; a disclosing party's confidentiality is ensured; conflict of interest is prevented; mature approach is used to addressing mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> Confidential information. Journalists have a moral responsibility for keeping their sources of information confidential. A journalist's professional association or professional organisation should define the level of protection of the disclosing party's confidentiality preferred or acceptable for the journalist.</p>
<p>The Collegium recommends that journalists never break their promise of confidentiality given to a disclosing party.</p>
<p> The right to make and the responsibility to correct a mistake. Like any other person, a journalist has the right to make mistakes. It is a journalist's duty to use all the available tools and methods to notify the consumer of the information about the journalist's mistake. Such notification should be made promptly and honestly as well as maintain the journalist's reputation and professional honour.</p>
<p>If any mistakes or significant inaccuracies or false or distorted data are found in a publication, the editorial team shall be deemed to have professionally addressed the situation if they have immediately corrected the journalist's or editor's mistake in compliance with the honest journalism principles and in a manner understandable to the person concerned.</p>
<p> 
Apologising. The decision to make an editorial apology is the authority of the editorial management. When professional or common moral grounds for apologising become obvious, the decision to apologise is a matter of conscience and professional responsibility of the journalist. The editorial team should neither interfere with the journalist's intent to make a personal apology in public nor should they force the journalist into this form of response to professional misconduct or personal moral mistake. 
</p>
<h3>Principle 5. Respect for privacy and human dignity</h3>
<p>Professional standards in journalism include honouring the right to privacy and human dignity in accordance with the provisions of international and national laws.</p>
<p>Respect for human dignity is reflected in professional ethical attitude to the reputation of the individuals targeted by the media, and in the refusal to use slander, insult and defamation.</p>
<p>Respect for human dignity means that a journalist is aware of and can professionally prevent the risk of discrimination against an individual on the grounds of their race, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other beliefs, ethnicity or social background.</p>
<p>Respect for human dignity also means that a journalist is capable of moral self-restraint, follows the professional prudence principle and understands that it is unacceptable to use a sensational approach when interviewing people who are in a state of grief or shock in order to report armed conflicts, catastrophes and natural disasters, disease or death.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> human dignity is respected; human rights are prioritised.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> The right to privacy is the right to live one's own life with a minimum of interference. This right covers an individual's personal, family and home life, physical and spiritual integrity, honour and reputation. Respect for privacy means that a journalist may not misrepresent a person, disclose any of their disadvantageous facts not related to public interest, publish private photographs without the person's consent, demonstrate any unreasonable, unacceptable or unwanted behaviour, misuse personal correspondence, disclose information provided or received on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The right of privacy may not be referred to by individuals whose own actions contribute to the dissemination of defamatory information about them.</p>
<p>The privacy of public figures and persons with prominent social standing should be protected, unless it may impact major social events. An individual involved in the news may not be deprived of their right of privacy.</p>
<p> Interference with privacy . It is unacceptable for a journalist to interfere with one's privacy, including the sanctity of their home, personal and family details, correspondence and health information.</p>
<p>Cases of overwhelming public interest are exceptions to this general professional rule.</p>
<p>The legitimacy and necessity of breaking the interference with privacy prohibition by a journalist or the editorial team should be proactively substantiated by the editorial team and may be subject to special critical review by the media self-regulation body.</p>
<p>A journalist may not process visual information electronically to misrepresent people or events.</p>
<p>A journalist may not unreasonably (i.e. without the signs of express or overwhelming public interest) spy on an object of their professional interest; a journalist should receive consent for taking pictures of and/or filming a person at all times, except when such person is in a public place.</p>
<p> The risk of discrimination . A journalist should use every endeavour to avoid even unintentional stimulation of discrimination against a person on the grounds of their race, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other beliefs, ethnicity or social background. A journalist should refrain from any derogatory innuendoes or comments about an individual's race, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other beliefs, ethnicity or social background. This kind of personal data can only be published where there is express public interest which can be clearly understood from the journalistic text.</p>
<p> Situations of grief and shock . A journalist may not present to the public any shocking details of crimes, accidents, natural disasters or the details and circumstances of one's disease, dying or death. Any exceptions made for the situations of intense interest must be clearly and professionally substantiated. The same rules apply to visual content (photographs and videos).</p>
<p>Individuals in a situation of personal grief or shock should be treated with empathy and respect. If published, information received from such persons can cause them even more suffering.</p>
<p> Information on children. The Collegium strongly recommends that anyone planning to publish any information about children or teenagers should consult the provisions of special reference documents such as Guidelines and Principles for Reporting on Issues Involving Children (adopted at the Annual Congress of the International Federation of Journalists in Seoul in 2001) and the UNICEF Ethical Guidelines for Reporting on Children .</p>
<p> Media coverage of crimes . Noting the presumption of innocence principle as one of the key civilisational values, the Collegium would like to reiterate the well-known provision of the Declaration of the Court Reporter Guild : 'investigative journalism cannot be prevented by the mere legal concept of presumption of innocence.' Supporting this idea, the Collegium wishes to reiterate the special responsibility a journalist has when they interview a person being publicly accused by the journalist (editorial team). Unless specific consent has been obtained, journalists should avoid mentioning the identity of family members and friends of suspects or convicts when making their accusations.</p>
<p>Particular care must be taken to prevent any further harm to children who are witnesses or victims of crime.</p>
<h3>Principle 6. Making a distinction between public interest and public curiosity</h3>
<p>Professional standards of journalism include respect for diversity of public interests, democratic institutions and social morality.</p>
<p>A journalist should distinguish between the public interests in a broad sense and public curiosity inherent in human nature but not directly related to the issues of public authority, the function of democratic institutions or the prospects of social development.</p>
<p>A journalist should differentiate the public interests they seek to meet in the media on a daily basis from the public interest narrowly defined but extremely important for both the profession and society, which causes them to make informed, morally hazardous professional efforts when exceptions to some restrictions or even prohibitions of journalism rules are possible (such efforts must be substantiated and driven by a clear necessity).</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> ability to identify a situation essential to social well-being and development, critical both for the society and profession, and making a journalist breach professional standards.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>Taking the approach of the UK Editors' Code of Practice (2004), the Collegium agrees that the public interest in journalism includes, but is not confined to:</p>
<ul>
<li>detecting or exposing crime or serious impropriety;</li>
<li>protecting public health and safety;</li>
<li>preventing the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever there is a reference to the public interest, the Collegium expects editors to explain how their actions based on such reference have served to protect the public interest in question.</p>
<h3>Principle 7. Respect for and protection of cultural diversity</h3>
<p>A journalist should adhere to the professional principles, that are based on the high humanistic ideas, and respect the special character, values and achievements of each culture, including the right of each nation to freely choose and develop its political, social, economic and cultural systems.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> ability to check professional values against general cultural values; using professional tools to oppose the destruction of society's cultural norms protecting the common good.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>In stressful situations which can emerge nowadays in any society under the pressure of terrorism, minority discrimination, bigotry or war, the media has a moral responsibility to protect democratic values and human dignity, encourage the search for peaceful settlement, nurture tolerance, refuse to participate in any activities stimulating intolerance in society. The media and journalists must use a professional approach in order to resist violence, hatred, confrontation, discrimination on cultural, religious and other grounds.</p>
<h3>Principle 8. Protection of the right to freedom of speech</h3>
<p>A journalist should consistently oppose any attempted censorship of their professional activities, understand the meaning of the protection of freedom of speech, contribute to the development of free, independent and accountable journalism as the utmost prerequisite for the existence and development of a democratic state and civil society.</p>
<p>In their relations with public authorities or economic organisations, a journalist should avoid doing anything which has the potential to undermine the journalist's independence or make text consumers doubt their critical approach and impartiality.</p>
<p>A journalist should value the trust of their audience in their personality and texts, remain editorially independent while taking each reasonable step to prevent the media from transforming into power/anti-power or getting out of democratic civil control.</p>
<p>In their relationships with colleagues, journalists should seek to maintain a fair competition/professional solidarity balance.</p>
<p>A journalist should understand the media's social accountability as an essential component of the stability of both the profession and civil society.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators:</strong> the reputation component; professional consistency; accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p>A journalist and the editorial team must respond to any identified sign of attempted 'indirect' censorship by publishing information about such attempt in the first place.</p>
<p>A journalist should avoid both actual and perceived conflicts of interest. A journalist, therefore, may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>accept any gifts or offers which could undermine their status of an independent, honest and impartial worker of the media;</li>
<li>use their professional status to exert pressure on any person for the purpose of taking advantage or meeting the journalist's personal needs;</li>
<li>use unpublished materials for their own or a third party benefit;</li>
<li>offer the editors materials containing hidden advertising. A journalist's words and deeds must guard the professional dignity and the prestige of their work. A journalist should not cooperate with media which tolerates the violations of the honest journalism principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>A journalist should agree that accountability is the norm for the media in a democratic society and, therefore, it is reasonable and appropriate to have any professional and ethical conflicts related to their publications settled by the national media self-regulatory body.</p>
<p><strong>Special notes</strong></p>
<p>If at any stage, a text or a situation referred to the Collegium for settlement as part of an information dispute is found to be inconsistent with the norms of journalism and in marked contrast to the provisions of this Standard of Media Ethics , the Collegium reserves the right to dismiss such dispute declaring itself out of jurisdiction. An ad hoc committee which began the processing of a complaint per se is expected to carry out a qualified assessment of the elements of the text/situation in dispute that either cause the committee members to doubt that the Collegium is dealing with journalism/work of a journalist or make a definitive, supposedly expert conclusion.</p>
<p>The Collegium would like to note that this version of the Standard of Media Ethics does not regulate the relationships between a journalist/an editorial team with bloggers and the 'new media' in general, the significant yet special, 'non-linear' actors of the contemporary mass media landscape, essentially not accountable to consumers either professionally or ethically (having no media ethical responsibilities) as in journalism or the work of 'traditional' media editors. The Collegium is planning to develop a special section within this document at a later stage, having reviewed the international and Russian cases of referring to assumed norms in this area, and, therefore, recommends that the media editorial teams:</p>
<p>a) take into account the general approach and key provisions related to the media ecology formation practicalities proposed by the Recommendation CM/Rec (2017) of the Committee of Ministers to member states on a new notion of media and *the Annex 'Criteria for identifying media and guidance for a graduated and differentiated response' to Recommendation CM/Rec (2017) of the Committee of Ministers to member states on a new notion of media;</p>
<p>b) use as a model or a guideline the structured editorial approach developed by the editors of the Echo of Moscow website in the relations with bloggers. </p>
<p>With regard to any information disputes related to blogging made by the workers of specific Russian media, the Collegium:</p>
<p>a) will address this category of disputes temporarily being guided by the specialised BBC Academy recommendations until the Collegium develops a sufficiently reliable system of criteria, assessments, and guidelines (based on the Russian practices in dealing with the emergence and settlement of this kind of conflicts);</p>
<p>b) recommends that the media editors formulate their own rules for blogging made by their staff by using the specialised BBC Academy recommendations and respective Russian experience, whenever possible reviewing and analysing their own media best practices and expert suggestions.</p>
<p>The Collegium invites the media editorial teams to notify their staff without unnecessary delay on the adoption of such rules and post them on the media website so that they can be accessed by the regular users (clients) of the media and the other actors of the mass communication area.</p>
<p>The Collegium believes that if a media editorial team notifies its consumers and clients (readers, listeners, viewers) about the text, contents or at least a brief overview of a specific resolution passed by the Collegium in respect of a complaint about such media's particular publication, it will be a sign of the editorial team's professional integrity and social accountability as well as an anticipated demonstration of their professional self-esteem and respect for their audience, consumers and clients.</p>
<p>The Collegium would like to thank everyone who is willing to disseminate and promote the provisions of this document in both the multifaceted area of work of the Russian media and their own editorial zone in the first place.</p>
<p>The current (third) Collegium understands that the Special Notes part of this Standard of Media Ethics must be substantially improved and is anticipating doing so prior to the expiry of its appointment.</p>
<p>The Collegium is planning to use the lessons learnt from the implementation of this Standard of Media Ethics elaborating both its specific provisions and the approach to a range of issues which have not been so far regulated herein and will appreciate everyone's efforts in supporting and providing hands-on assistance with the work performed by the Collegium in this regard.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Annex 1<strong> </strong>to Standard of Media Ethics adopted by Public Collegium for Press Complaints</h3>
<p><strong>JOURNALISM IN THE NEW MEDIA CONTEXT</strong></p>
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The rapid development of information and communication technology, dramatic change in the media ecosystem, emergence of new actors in the media environment and new media content producers (from bloggers, robotic media, virtual reality and augmented reality experts to social media users and the so-called 'citizen journalists') have caused challenges and risks that modern journalists have never faced before, which require a thorough update and clarification of the professional ethics standards. These main risks and challenges are the following: the speed and globality of information dissemination; visual content is gradually replacing the 'text-centric' media; the loss of online 'privacy'; the boundaries of a private life are getting smaller while the author can still remain anonymous; the development of technology for copying, processing, dissemination and manipulation of information; etc.</p>
<p>In these contexts, the significance of some traditional values of journalism decrease (e.g. published material will only remain exclusive and unique for a limited period of time before it is reposted online), while others become much more appreciated (e.g. the value of accuracy: the need for fact-checking and verification of information is higher in the media environment with multiple performers), and other values are getting more challenging in practice (e.g. the widespread rewriting techniques have reshaped the take on literary property: compliance with the plagiarism intolerance principle today means making mandatory citations rather than total refusal to use other authors' materials).</p>
<p>However, problems are caused by both the new 'universal' offline principles of journalist ethics and the ethical postulates which additionally emerge as a result of social transformation of the value perceptions and the digital audience's updated needs.</p>
<p>It seems fair to say that the pre-Internet journalism values of impartiality, accuracy and pre-publication fact-checking are currently clashing with the digital journalism culture with its emphasis on simplicity, emotionality and the possibility to make clarifications and other amendments after publication. This does not mean, however, that the professional journalist community refuses to actively oppose against things which are morally unacceptable - it only means they recognise that today's mass media operate in the context of high mobility and the 'fluidity' of the media environment with its technologies which change before the new rules of work can be formulated. </p>
<p>Realising that a) a professional journalist can exist and operate in the current media environment playing many roles at the same time - of a media worker, social media user, blogger, etc.; and b) the contemporary media world lacks the uniform and versatile ethics policies (bloggers, digital photographers, entertainment content producers, etc. set for themselves different rules of conduct online while actively contributing to the creation and dissemination of information), the Collegium believes that this does not prevent anyone from the development of strong ethical values, norms and principles of a professional journalist behaviour in the new media environment and the complicated media ecology.</p>
<p>The Collegium understands that no ethics policy can regulate any of the professional conflicts that may arise or propose the universal standards suitable for work in any context, therefore, the Collegium recommends that the editorial teams comply with the following general guidelines for journalists working in the new media environment.</p>
<h3>Journalist behaviour in social media</h3>
<p>Social media is a sort of information space where the mass media audience currently 'lives', and a significant portion the media content flows to. Social media are also the media environment where a professional journalist can play the role of both an agent of a press corporation (e.g. on the official pages of media outlets) and as a private person, which creates the ground for a conflict  of interest between: </p>
<p>a) the corporate interests of the editorial team and the journalist's right to personal judgement and freedom of speech;</p>
<p>b) confidentiality of internal media information and the journalist's 'continuous publicity';</p>
<p>c) the content created for 'home use' and press materials that serve as the background context of the social media account;</p>
<p>d) the publisher's institutional reputation and the journalist's personal image.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> The second-pair-of-eyes rule. Any content posted by a journalist in the social media on behalf of or under the name of the editorial team or any of its divisions is subject to editorial approval, editing or moderation. The editorial team's official account may contain publications in various formats (texts, videos, images, etc.), the style and forms of maintaining web pages can be different, but the professional and ethical regulations are the same as those applied to the editorial team's main activities.</p>
<p> Corporate responsibility in journalism. Even if journalists use social media as private persons, other users perceive them as representatives of their respective media outlets, which means that journalists must not undermine the audience's belief in the impartiality, independence and competence of the organisation. A journalist who has disclosed their affiliation with a specific media outlet should not share any confidential corporate information, run any political campaigns or criticise their colleagues. Journalists should make a disclaimer that any opinions expressed by them in their personal accounts are those of their own and they do not purport to reflect the opinions of the editorial team.</p>
<p> Professional responsibility in journalism. On their personal pages in the social media, journalists should comply with each professional standard related to respect for privacy and human dignity, avoid being offensive to people or events, be careful in their statements on the issues that can potentially cause public conflict. As in their professional activities, they must make sure that no inaccurate, misleading or distorted content is published in the social media under their name.</p>
<h3>Interaction with blogosphere and UGC (user-generated content)</h3>
<p>With the development of blogging (online journaling) and UGC (user-generated content) current information has become faster and more complete, yet it sparked controversy about the responsibility for accuracy and the amount of the content published</p>
<p>in the new media. Working with bloggers and using the content created by non-journalism organisations, journalists should understand that, by contrast with 'traditional' press, these media actors have no professional or ethical responsibility to society and, therefore, it is journalists' duty to exercise reasonable care disseminating such content.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> Differentiation of user-generated content. Any user-generated content (such as posts made by persons carrying out information work on their own initiative, news from bloggers, etc.) should be clearly differentiated from the content prepared by professional journalists and editorial teams.</p>
<p> Verification and fact-checking. When using any content created and posted by bloggers or other online users, each journalist should thoroughly check such content to make sure that it is accurate, impartial, honest, respecting personal dignity and is compliant with other general norms and standards of ethics applicable to the professional media.</p>
<p> Labelling unverified or erroneous information. Any relevant but not finally verified information received from a blogger or other online user should be labelled as such. If new facts are further discovered or it becomes clear that a previous publication contained errors, a journalist should amend such content and/or add an error notification.</p>
<h3>Robot automation of news journalism</h3>
<p>Algorithm-driven technology, including robots writing news stories, is no longer a rare exception in journalism and it is becoming the new normal in the foreign and Russian press. However, the algorithm-driven tools, which not just collect and structure information but also highlight newsworthy events, generate text and perform many more things, have increased the demand for special journalism roboethics which the journalist community is only beginning to comprehend.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> The authorship and responsibility issue. There is no consensus about the authorship of the machine-generated content (the area of responsibility of programmers, journalists and managers), but the editorial team and the journalists who use such content are still responsible for the publication of false, misinterpreted or distorted data. This is because journalists must verify each source of information, including internal and algorithm-driven ones.</p>
<p> The labelling issue. There is no consensus on whether to label machine-generated content as such, yet it is better to mention it to the audience so that they know they are reading a text created by a robot.</p>
<h3>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) journalism</h3>
<p>VR and AR journalism (also known as 'immersion journalism' or 'presence journalism') has become a part of the modern media and offers new breakthroughs in the media enhancement as technology continues to develop. However, a journalist's reputation could be undermined if technology innovation and the emotional involvement of the audience are prioritised over the accuracy and impartiality of the content.</p>
<p><strong>Professional rules and standards</strong></p>
<p> Fair presentation of images. A journalist using VR and AR technology and, therefore, having multiple options for digital processing and modification of the 'picture' for the sake of influencing the audience, must nevertheless comply with the standards of professional ethics, particularly provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene.</p>
<p> Limits of 'immersion'. A journalist using VR and AR technology to increase empathy in the viewers should be careful about the effects their publication may have on the audience: a journalist should add a warning of shocking or scary content, observe the personal data protection principle, etc.</p>"
"46_SE";"Sweden";"SE";"Code of Ethics for Press, Radio and Television in Sweden";"<h1>Code of Ethics for Press, Radio and Television in Sweden</h1>
<p>The press, radio and television shall have the greatest possible degree of freedom, within the framework of the Freedom of the Press Act and the constitutional right of freedom of speech, in order to be able to serve as disseminators of news and as scrutinizers of public affairs. In this connection, however, it is important that the individual is protected from unwarranted suffering as a result of publicity.</p>
<p>Ethics does not consist primarily of the application of a formal set of rules but in the maintenance of a responsible attitude in the exercise of journalistic duties. The code of ethics for press, radio and television is intended to provide support for this attitude.</p>
<h3>WHAT CAN THE MEDIA OMBUDSMAN REVIEW?</h3>
<p>
The Media Ombudsman can review printed newspapers and magazines, Swedish broadcast radio and television, as well as some online publications, i.e. online publications that are members of The Swedish Media Publishers' Association (TU-Medier i Sverige) or The Magazine Publishers Association (Sveriges Tidskrifter), alternatively having filed for membership of the Ethical Press System.
</p>
<h3>RULES ON PUBLICITY</h3>
<p><strong>Provide accurate news</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The role played by the mass media in society and the trust of the public of these media call for accurate and objective news reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be critical of news sources. Check facts as carefully as possible in the light of the circumstances even if they have been published earlier. Allow the reader/listener/viewer the possibility of distinguishing between statements of fact and comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News bills, headlines and introductory sections must be supported by the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the authenticity of pictures. See to it that pictures and graphical illustrations are correct and are not used in a misleading way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treat rebuttals generously</strong></p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>
<p>Factual errors should be corrected when called for. Anyone wishing to rebut a statement shall, if this is legitimate, be given the opportunity to do so.

"47_SI";"Slovenia";"SI";"Code of ethics for journalists of Slovenia";"# CODE OF ETHICS FOR JOURNALISTS OF SLOVENIA

### Preamble
*Arising from the freedom of expression and the right to public sector information as the fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and international documents regarding the protection of human rights, and from the principles of the Munich Declaration, the journalists of Slovenia, joined together under the Slovene Association of Journalists and the Slovenian Union of Journalists, hereby adopt this Code. The Code contains ethical standards which serve as directives and obligations regarding the work of journalists and other content creators which is published in the Slovenian media, regardless of the work's form of distribution. The compliance of individual actions with this Code is determined by the Journalists' Ethics Council, a joint body of the Slovene Association of Journalists and the Slovenian Union of Journalists. The Code is amended and clarified as per the Recommendations of the Journalists' Ethics Council (N?R).*

### Journalistic work

1. A journalist has to verify the accuracy of the collected information and avoid errors. Errors that are made - even though unintentional - must be acknowledged and remedied. In this case, the N?R can rule that the journalist was not in breach of the Code.

2. A journalist must avoid the improper or personally offensive presentation of information and facts.

3. When publishing information that contains serious accusations, a journalist shall generally obtain a response from the persons concerned and put this response in the same article or, if delayed, obtain a response as soon as possible. The same must also be done when summarising serious accusations from other media or archives. If the journalist could not obtain a response, this lack of response shall be explained to the public.

4. A journalist must not withhold information crucial for understanding the covered topic.

5. It shall be noted when a journalist publishes unverified information, rumours, or speculation.

6. Whenever possible, a journalist must state the source of the information.

7. When publishing research results, a journalist must state the contracting entity, the provider, and the duration of the conducted research. When publishing public opinion polling results, wherever possible, the sample and method should also be mentioned. If that information could not be obtained, the public shall be made aware of the lack of such information.

8. A journalist can agree to ensure the anonymity of the source of identifiable information. Such a source can be used only if the information could not be obtained in a different manner and publishing it is within the public interest. The journalist shall honour the agreement regarding the anonymity of the source.

9. A journalist shall avoid paying for information.

10. Editing, forecasts, titles, and subtitles must not distort the content. A symbolic or stock photograph shall also be appropriately marked.

11. Plagiarism or forgery of documents is prohibited.

12. \* A journalist must not use illicit means of collecting information. If the information which is of the utmost importance to the public cannot be obtained otherwise, the journalist's actions as well as the reasons for them must be presented to the public.

13. \* A journalist must always be introduced as a journalist and explain the purpose of the journalist's collecting data. The status of a journalist can only be withheld if the journalist tried to obtain information that serves the public interest but could not obtain said information while declaring the journalist status.

14. \* A journalist can record audio or video, and take pictures only after the consent of the person being recorded or photographed has been given. The consent can also be tacit (e.g., if the person does not object). Under exceptional circumstances, a journalist can record and take pictures without consent if the journalist reasonably believes that, by doing so, the journalist shall uncover information that serves the public interest. The reasons for the journalist's decision must be explained in the article.

15. A journalist shall distinguish between information and commentary. The difference between a report on the facts and commentary must be sufficiently clear so that the addressee of the report can distinguish between the facts, and the views or opinions of the journalist.

  

### Electronic publications

16. The editor-in-chief is responsible for the contents of the commentaries and other audio-visual materials of the readers, listeners, or viewers. The editor-in-chief shall establish rules for the selection and inclusion of commentaries. A commentary that does not comply with the published rules must be removed as soon as possible.

16a. The editor-in-chief is responsible for the transparent supplementation and correction of the contents of online media and establishes the rules. When a journalist or an editor corrects an error, the intervention must be marked in such a way that it is clear what the error was. When an article is merely supplemented with new information, the time of the latest amendment must be evident.

### General ethical standards

17. \* A journalist shall respect the right of an individual to privacy and avoid sensational and unwarranted disclosure of the individual's privacy in public. An intervention in the privacy of an individual is justifiable only if the public interest outweighs the respect for privacy. When reporting about public figures and those who want to gain power and influence, and draw attention, the right of the public to information is more extensive. A journalist should bear in mind that collecting and publishing the information, photographs, and recordings of the individuals can hurt those individuals who are not used to the attention of the media and the public.

  The journalist must be particularly considerate when mentioning names or publishing photographs and recordings of persons involved in accidents, and offenders or victims.

18. A journalist shall take into account that no one is guilty until guilt has been proven by a competent authority's decision. If the decision is not final, this shall be noted by the journalist.

19. A journalist must show special consideration when publishing photographs or recordings, collecting information, and reporting about children and minors, persons with developmental, physical, and mental disabilities, and members of other vulnerable groups.

20. A journalist shall avoid ethnic, racial, gender, age, religious, geographical, and other stereotypes, and details related to sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, social status, or other personal circumstances of individuals and groups.

21. Incitement to violence, dissemination of hatred and intolerance, and other forms of hate speech are prohibited. A journalist must not permit such actions and if that is not possible, the journalist must immediately respond to or condemn such actions.

22. In the articles on sexual abuses and family tragedies, a journalist shall not disclose the identities of victims and their family members, and the identities of offenders shall not be disclosed when that action would disclose the identities of the victims. The same shall apply for articles on other criminal offences when minors are included in them. Identities can be disclosed provided there is consent from the adult victims.

23. A journalist shall report about suicide and attempted suicide only if it serves the public interest. In doing so, the causes and circumstances of suicide or attempted suicide are stated with caution. Methods and locations of the deed are not stated. The identity of the person who committed suicide or attempted to commit suicide is disclosed only if it serves the public interest. The exception to this is reporting about historical figures.
  
  

### Conflicts of interests  

24. If a journalist is personally involved in the events the journalist is reporting about and this therefore presents a conflict of interests, the journalist shall either disclose this conflict of interests, or discontinue reporting the events.

25. Intertwining or joining journalistic and advertising or political propaganda texts is prohibited. Advertising messages, paid publications, and paid advertisements must be recognisably and clearly distinguished from journalistic texts. If there is any doubt, the text must be clearly designated as an advertisement. Hybrids between advertising or political propaganda and journalistic texts are prohibited.

26. In order for a journalist to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interests, the journalist must refuse gifts, favours, rewards, and other benefits. The journalist shall avoid work outside of the journalist profession which would reduce his credibility or the credibility of the journalist community.

27. A journalist shall not misuse the information on financial events obtained in the journalist's professional work for personal interests. If the journalist trades securities about which he reports, the journalist shall disclose this information to the public.

  

### The rights of journalists and relations with the public

28. A journalist has the right to turn down a job that is in breach of this Code and the professional standards of the journalist profession.

29. No one shall change the meaning or rewrite the article of a journalist without the journalist's consent. A journalist has the right to sign articles written by the journalist. It is not possible to sign said articles without the journalist's knowledge or against the journalist's will.

\* When applying the exceptions permitted by Articles 12, 13, 14, and 17, and when interfering with the rights of others, a journalist must obtain the opinion of the editor-in-chief.

<h3>V JOURNALISTS? ATTENTIONA</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to approach their work with due professional care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist must not blindly trust sources of information. A journalist must keep in mind that information sources often have their own interests or interests of the social groups to whom they belong, and that they adjust their statements to such interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>In contact with sources of information a special care is required to avoid real or apparent inclination, arising out of close personal relationships.</li>
<li>Readers/viewers/listeners must be notified regarding direct benefits that the source can achieve from publishing said information. If the source has a direct interest, or is trying to deal with someone, readers/viewers/listeners must be informed.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Keeping secret the facts that might significantly affect the public perception of an event is equal to their deliberate distortion or lying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>

<li>Journalists should avoid phrases that are chauvinist, sexist, or other discriminatory connotations (for example: the fairer sex, member of the stronger sex' and the alike).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3>VI RELATION TO THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A journalist has the right to investigate all circumstances and facts regarding the events that are of public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While collecting information a journalist must not use extortion, threats and persecution against the source of information. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides the fact that they must not threaten the sources of information, journalists should not promise a favourable coverage in exchange for information.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to respect a request for anonymity from the source of information. Inventing anonymous sources is a serious offense to the standards of journalists' professional conduct.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using anonymous (confidential) sources of information is generally not recommended, unless there is no other way to acquire the information which is deemed to be of utmost importance to the public.</li>
<li>Often, the use of unnamed sources of information is only the way for the source or a journalist/media to present inaccurate, incomplete or insufficiently verified information. In case it transpires that hiding the source is used to cover their absence, the credibility of journalists/media will be seriously undermined.</li>
<li>Anonymity/confidentiality should be provided for the sources that can provide “first hand', information, that is, documents that directly confirm or, by itself, represent information of great public importance.</li>
<li>An editor is required to check with the journalist the justification for the use of anonymous (confidential) sources of information. Regarding this, it is necessary that at least one editor knows and protects the identity of an anonymous source. </li>
<li>If the source of information requests from the journalist that their identity remain confidential even to the editor, this request should be rejected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to present themself to a source of information and name a media they work for at that moment, except if doing differently is in the public interest and when it is done in accordance with the rules set out in this Code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>False impersonation and false identification of the media a journalist works for is not permitted. Journalists on assignment must not present themselves as persons who have special powers, business people or “ordinary citizens'.</li>
<li>Concealing the identity of a journalist can be used only as the final means to obtain information: if other methods have been unsuccessfully applied, if the information cannot be obtained in any other way, and only when it relates to information of great importance to the public.</li>
<li>In case of concealing the journalists' identity, it is necessary that the editorial board is informed, and it is recommended to consult legal advisors for possible legal consequences.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>
<p>At the request of an editor a journalist may tell them the identity of a source who wishes to remain anonymous, and the editor is obliged to protect the anonymity of the source. </p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a source of information is unnamed, the editor must be informed of the identity of the source, since both, journalists and editors are responsible for the accuracy of the information published.</li>
<li>A journalist has the right not to disclose the identity of an anonymous (confidential) source to the editor. In this case, the editor may decide not to publish the information obtained from a source unknown to them, and this procedure shall not be considered censorship and is in accordance with the Code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Juveniles, as a rule, may be interviewed only in the presence of, or with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist must never abuse the emotions of other people, their ignorance or lack of judgement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sources of information with which journalists converse are not always aware of the power of the media and the consequences that their statements may have on them personally, as well as on people they are talking about. Conscious abuse is incompatible with journalism, as well as inattention whose possible consequence could be abuse of the collocutor.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""8"">
<li>A journalist must not unjustly create fear among people or instill false hopes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A journalist who deliberately encourages unfounded fears and hopes of readers/viewers/listeners, especially because of the “attractiveness' of the text/report, violates the Code in the most extreme manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VII RESPECT FOR PRIVACY</h3>
<ol>
<li>A journalist respects the privacy, dignity and integrity of the people they write about. The right to privacy is narrowed when public figures are in question, especially public officials. </li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>When reporting on accidents and crimes, publishing the names and photographs of victims and perpetrators that clearly identify them is not permitted. Also, publishing any information which could indirectly reveal the identity of either victim, or the perpetrator, before the relevant authority officially
announces is not allowed.</li>
<li>A journalist must have an awareness of the power of media, or the possible consequences for the victim or the perpetrator, if their identity is disclosed. They must take into account, in particular, the weight of the possible consequences in case of any errors/incorrect assumptions in reporting.</li>
<li>Even if the relevant state authorities publish information which are in the domain of privacy of the perpetrator or the victim, the media must not transmit that information. The error of the state authorities does not imply “permission' for the violation of ethical principles of the profession.</li>
<li>Public figures are aware in advance that their right to privacy is somewhat limited, but this does not mean that the media can violate it without any reason or explanation.</li>
<li>Data from the private lives of public figures are published only if it is in the public interest, or if they have a direct impact on a number of people, if they are in contradiction with the spirit of the function which that person performs, or ideas that the person publicly advocates.</li>
<li>In case of death of a public figure, the media must be particularly careful with the information which subsequently associates that person with an offense or discriminatory information. Even when it comes to information of public importance, a journalist must be aware that the deceased persons are legally released from further prosecution.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>
<p>Journalists and editors should especially avoid speculations and transmitting insufficiently verifiable attitudes in reporting on accidents and tragedies which have resulted in deaths or when the financial and other interests of the citizens are severely affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reporting on events involving personal pain and shock, a journalist is obliged to adapt their questions so that they reflect the spirit of compassion and discretion.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photographers and cameramen are obliged to act with respect and compassion when taking pictures of victims of accidents and crimes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist is obliged to ensure that a child is not endangered or placed at risk due to the publication of their name, photograph or recording with their image, house, the community in which they live or recognisable surroundings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representatives of the state and public institutions working in child protection are sometimes unaware of the way media function and their wider impact. The information that they provide to journalists often involves disclosure of the identity of juveniles. A journalist must not abuse their good intentions or ignorance. Information received from doctors, social workers, teachers, and so on, which directly or indirectly refers to the identity of juveniles, must not be published.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VIII UTILISING HONOURABLE MEANS</h3>
<ol>
<li>While collecting information, photos, documents, audio and video a journalist will only utilise honourable means. </li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journalists and editors must not publish material acquired by using hidden cameras, listening devices, or unauthorised wiretapping, except when the public interest is protected (for example: disclosure of information regarding the threat to life and health of the population, corruption, abuse of power, etc.). </li>
<li>For the application of this exception there must be a clearly defined and transparent editorial procedure. </li>
<li>Gathering information by bribing sources is incompatible with journalism.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>
<p>A journalist should not continue asking questions, phoning, photographing or recording a private person after they were asked to stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressure on a private person to answer any questions can be continued after the rejection, but only on condition that there is a grounded public interest at stake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A journalist has the right, in relation to the state and other institutions, to continually ask questions that they believe are of public interest, regardless of whether they are asked to stop or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>IX RESPECTING AUTHORSHIP</h3>
<ol>
<li>Media and journalists respect and application of current legislation on copyright. When permission for reproduction from another source is received, this is done with respect for the author and with naming the source.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If a work of authorship or a study is paraphrased, it is necessary to specify the author or the source.
</li>
<li>Photos must be signed using the name of the author or the owner of the photos.</li>
<li>Violation of copyright by an unauthorised reprinting, copying photographs from print media, “downloading' photos from the Internet, is considered a severe violation of the Code. - Photos cannot be leased to other individuals, organisations, institutions and media without the author′s permission.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>A journalist will not undersign as theirs text, drawing, illustration, photograph, video and audio clips of other authors. </li>

</ol>
<ul>

<li>in case when a journalist has a reasonable interest (personal security, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A journalist should not be undersigned if they did not participate in the preparation and production of the texts, photographs, drawings, illustrations, audio and video recordings.</li>
<li>If, by changing of the headline, title and subtitle, an editor changed the meaning and intonation of the text, photographs, drawings, illustrations, audio and video recordings, a journalist is obliged to draw attention to the editor, and to require changes.

With regard to press members and organs, the Supreme Board of the Press Council may decide to find the complaint ' insufficient' , ' warn' or condemn' as a result of applications made to it.

Each press organ agreeing with the Professional Principles of the Press and the Press Council Agreement pays a certain amount of fee.

## HOW TO APPLY TO THE PRESS COUNCIL?

### APPLICATION AND ASSESSMENT METHODS

The Supreme Board of the Press Council settles the applications of journalists and press organs (written, oral, visual) against whom an accusation is duly made that they have acted contrary to the Professional Principles of the Press.

In order for a matter of violation regarding the Professional Principles of the Press to be handled by the Supreme Board, it is sufficient that any person appropriately applies (by petition, via phone or the Internet) to the Press Council on a matter which s/he deems worthy of complaint. The applications of organizations, which have the authority to represent a certain profession or community, related to relevant sections of the society are also taken into account.

The Secretary-General informs the reporter and the institution of the complaint after receiving the application, and requests a response. S/he tries to reconcile the parties; and if this is not possible, brings the report and the file to the Supreme Board of the Press Council meeting.

The Supreme Board of the Press Council holds a meeting with the participation of at least 11 members and discusses the matter. Decisions are taken by the majority of those present. Each member has one vote. A vote only reflects the opinion of its owner. No-one can abstain during voting. The member of the Supreme Board cannot participate in the negotiations for complaints related to the institution s/he represents, and cannot vote.

The judgment of the Supreme Board of the Press Council are definite. However, an extraordinary appeal could be made within 15 days from the announcement of the decision on the grounds that a material error was made in the first examination or an evidence presented by the complainant and the complainee were not evaluated. A Board consisting of the President, the Vice President and the Secretary-General submit the Report related to the appeal to the Supreme Board. The relevant parties are invited to the Supreme Board's meeting where the report related to the appeal is discussed. The Supreme Board makes an assessment after hearing the participating parties. The first decision of the Supreme Board can be changed by the votes of at least 2/3 of the participants in the meeting.

At the latest, complaints may cover two months before the date of application. At the latest, the application is settled in two months from the date of the application.

Any matter related to the Supreme Board's negotiations and voting is confidential unless otherwise decided. If the Board deems it necessary or receives a request from the parties, it listens to the persons concerned and may call witnesses.

The conclusion of the application by the Secretary-General through reconciling the parties is not an obstacle for the Supreme Board to handle the matter. It can release to the public the opinion and the decision related to the matter resulting in reconciliation like its other decisions.

The above limitation may be exceeded in the assessment of the applications made by journalists to defend their professional practices for the issues which are formally handled by the Supreme Board of the Press Council without waiting for an application."

*Ethics Code of Ukrainian Journalists*

1. Freedom of speech and expression are an inseparable part of journalistic work.
2. Serving the interests of the government or owners, not the society, is a breach of the ethics code.
3. A journalist has to respect people's private life. At the same time his right to investigative journalism is saved, when it is connected to some other events or facts, which are a matter of public importance and aimed at protecting social and individual interests.
4. Court procedures coverage must be impartial. A journalist cannot call a person criminal before a conformable court verdict is announced.
5. A journalist doesn't uncover his (her) informational sources, except cases when the Ukrainian law demands it.
6. Respecting public's right to full and objective information on facts and events is a journalist's first duty. Journalists and editors must take measures to check reliability of all the reports, video- and audio materials, which came from public, freelancers, press-cutting service and other sources.
7. Information and analytical materials must be distinctively separated from advertising by particular headings.
8. Editorial correction of material including pictures, texts, headlines, video and script accordance, etc. should not distort the content of the material. A journalist must notify the audience of rehearsed or reconstructed news. 
9. Facts, thoughts and assumptions have to be clearly separated from each other. Spreading information which contains biased or groundless accusations is inadmissible.
10. Opponents' viewpoints including those who have become objects of a journalists criticism must be presented in a balanced way. Independent experts' estimations must be presented in a balanced way, as well.
11. Selectively quoted sociological research which distorts the content is not admissible. Public opinion polls cannot be fabricated to find out a result defined in advance.
12. A journalist must do everything possible to correct any published information if it turned out to be untrue.
13. A journalist must not use illegal methods of gathering information. While gathering information a journalist works within the Ukrainian legal framework and can use all legal procedures, including court procedures against those who prevent him (her) from gathering information. The use of secret ways of information gathering is acceptable only in cases when it provides accuracy and trustworthiness of the material. These ways can only be justified when other ways of gathering information are impossible to fulfill.
14. Plagiarism is incompatible with the status of a journalist.
15. No one can be discriminated because of gender, language, race, religion or ethnic, social origin or political preferences. This information can be pointed out only if it is a necessary part of the material. A journalist should avoid offensive words and foul language, hints or comments about person physical disabilities or diseases.
16. A journalist cannot be committed with work discipline to write or do something that does not suit his (her) own principles. A journalist should resist any outside interference in the content, no matter if it is a direct pressure or actions that have got features of an indirect interference.
17. Illegal receiving of profit or any benefits for any journalistic material done or not done is incompatible with the status of a journalist. A journalist must not use his (her) official position for private profit, with the purpose of easy money, self-advertisement, making his (her) own ways up or willing to please any powers or individuals. A journalist has no right to use financial data before publishing with the purpose of his (her) own enrichment.
18. A journalist has to be especially careful covering issues connected to children. A journalist and editor must have valid reasons to cover the private life of minors and permission from his (her) parents or guardians. It is inadmissible to uncover the names of minors (or other features of recognition), who became participants of events, connected to crime or violence.
19. Deliberate violation of the ethics code is absolutely incompatible with professional journalism, falls under public condemnation and can be a reason for press-card deprivation or loss of membership in trade unions or in National Union of Journalists of Ukraine. Ethical or professional conflict situations are examined by the Commission of journalism ethics."

<h3>About the Editors' Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Editors' Code of Practice sets out the rules that newspapers and magazines regulated by IPSO have agreed to follow. </li>
<li>The Code is written and administered by the Editors' Code Committee and enforced by IPSO.</li>
<li>The latest version of the Editors' Code of Practice came into effect on 1 January 2021. Download the previous version here.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>The Code – including this preamble and the public interest exceptions below – sets the framework for the highest professional standards that members of the press subscribing to the Independent Press Standards Organisation have undertaken to maintain. It is the cornerstone of the system of voluntary self-regulation to which they have made a binding contractual commitment. It balances both the rights of the individual and  the public's right to know.</p>
<p>To achieve that balance, it is essential that an agreed Code be honoured not only to the letter, but in the full spirit. It should be interpreted neither so narrowly as to compromise its commitment to respect the rights of the individual, nor so broadly that it infringes the fundamental right to freedom of expression – such as to inform, to be partisan, to challenge, shock, be satirical and to entertain – or prevents publication in the public interest.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of editors and publishers to apply the Code to editorial material in both printed and online versions of their publications. They should take care to ensure it is observed rigorously by all editorial staff and external contributors, including non-journalists.</p>
<p>Editors must maintain in-house procedures to resolve complaints swiftly and, where required to do so, co- operate with IPSO. A publication subject to an adverse adjudication must publish it in full and with due prominence, as required by IPSO.</p>

<p>iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.</p>
<p>iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.</p>

<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>i) Everyone is entitled to respect for private and family life, home, physical and mental health, and correspondence, including digital communications.</p>

<p>iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Intrusion into grief or shock</strong></li>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Reporting Suicide</strong></li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>i) All pupils should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion.</p>
<p>ii) They must not be approached or photographed at school without permission of the school authorities.</p>
<p>iii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or photographed on issues involving their own or another child's welfare unless a custodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.</p>
<p>iv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material involving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their children or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.</p>
<p>v) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's private life.</p>
<ol start=""7"">
<li><strong>Children in sex cases</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The press must not, even if legally free to do so, identify children under 16 who are victims or witnesses in cases involving sex offences.

<li><strong>Reporting of Crime</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>iii) Editors should generally avoid naming children under the age of 18 after arrest for a criminal offence but before they appear in a youth court unless they can show that the individual's name is already in the public domain, or that the individual (or, if they are under 16, a custodial parent or similarly responsible adult) has given their consent. This does not restrict the right to name juveniles who appear in a crown court, or whose anonymity is lifted.</p>
<ol start=""10"">
<li><strong>Clandestine devices and subterfuge</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>i) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held information without consent.</p>
<p>ii) Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.</p>
<ol start=""11"">
<li><strong>Victims of sexual assault</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The press must not identify or publish material likely to lead to the identification of a victim of sexual assault unless there is adequate justification and they are legally free to do so.

<p>i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness – or any person who may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness – should be made in any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of Court Act 1981. This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its verdict.</p>
<p>ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public interest and there is an over-riding need to  make or promise payment for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the outcome of a trial.</p>

### Preamble to the Impress Standards Code

Journalism plays a crucial role in society. Every day, journalists report significant events, policies and controversies, expose wrongdoing, challenge unfairness and satirise, amuse and entertain. Such power comes with responsibility. IMPRESS aims to ensure that journalists behave responsibly, while protecting their role to investigate and report freely.

All publishers regulated by IMPRESS agree to abide by the following rules, which together constitute the IMPRESS Standards Code. This Code seeks to balance the rights of the public, journalists and publishers. The Code should be read alongside the guidance, which provides information about what these rules mean in practice.

This Code is intended to be:

(a) A practical working tool that enables journalists, editors and publishers to do their jobs;

(b) Easily understood by the public; and,

(c) Effectively enforceable through IMPRESS powers and remedies as a regulator.


Publishers will be held directly responsible for compliance with this Code, which applies to all content and newsgathering activities for which publishers are responsible under the terms of their Regulatory Scheme Agreement with IMPRESS, regardless of the medium or platform of publication. All references here to publishers apply equally to anyone acting under a publisher authority. All references here to journalists apply equally to anyone acting in a journalistic capacity.

This Code is distinct from the law and publishers are separately responsible for ensuring that they comply with the law.


### Public Interest

In certain circumstances, there may be a public interest justification for a particular method of newsgathering or publication of an item of content that might otherwise breach the Code. Where a public interest exception may apply, this is identified in the relevant clause. A public interest means that the public has a legitimate stake in a story because of the contribution it makes to a matter of importance to society. 

Such interests include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) The revelation or discussion of matters such as serious incompetence or unethical behaviour that affects the public;

(b) Putting the record straight where an individual or organisation has misled the public on a matter of public importance;

(c) Revealing that a person or organisation may be failing to comply with any legal obligation they have;

(d) The proper administration of government;

(e) Open, fair and effective justice;

(f) Public health and safety;

(g) National security;

(h) The prevention and detection of crime; and

(i) The discussion or analysis of artistic or cultural works.


The following provisions apply where a publisher is about to undertake an action that they think would otherwise breach the Code, but for which they believe they have a public interest justification. The action might be a particular method of newsgathering or publication of an item of content. Before undertaking the action, the publisher should, where practicable, make a contemporaneous note, which establishes why they believe that:

(a) The action is in the public interest;

(b) They could not have achieved the same result using measures that are compliant with the Code;

(c) The action is likely to achieve the desired outcome; and

(d) Any likely harm caused by the action does not outweigh the public interest in the action.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Press Council of Kosovo (PCK) is an independent self-regulation body of print media of Kosovo where daily newspaper, periodicals, magazines and news agencies are part of it. PCK guarantees the implementation of Press Code of Kosovo and the development of reputation of print media. Press Council of Kosovo is a self-regulation body of print media, to ensure that these values and Press Code will be applied equally and for the good of society and its citizens.</p>
<p>Press Code of Kosovo, updated on June 2013, was firstly approved in 2005. The aim of this guide is to support the responsible use of freedom of speech in mass communication and to incite the discussion on professional ethic of journalism. The guide offers explanations and additional clarifications of Press Code of Kosovo's dispositions, with the intention to facilitate the implementation of them in practice. This guide that deals with print journalism is drafted specifically for purposes of self-regulation of print media and their editorial offices to improve ethic level of reporting and also the quality and credibility of the journalism. The Code's guide is based on Kosovo's media practice, in national and international legislation.</p>

If the investigation, charges, or court verdict has been part of any article or news then the case should be followed until it is closed. The journalist in a particular way has to be careful not to publish the identity of a minor. Family members or other relatives' identity of the suspect or sentenced person should be saved, except the cases when they are accomplices. When reporting the crime, religion and ethnicity of the suspect should not be mentioned, apart when the information is important for the public opinion to fully understand the event.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Protection of children and minors</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Media are obliged to act in accordance with the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Kosovo legislation. Media need to have the permission of parents or tutors to interview, take videos or pictures of children under the age of 18. Media will not identify children under the age of 16, if they are involved in criminal acts as witness or defendant. Media will not interview, disturb, take pictures or videos of children in school or near it without having the permission of administrators of school.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Media will not report private life of any person, apart the cases when there is public interest * for such a matter. Reporting on public persons, is unrestricted in any field of personal and professional activities, if there is public interest *. Media should not take pictures of people in private environments without having their permission, apart the cases when there is public interest * for such a matter.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Copyright</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Media are allowed to refer only to the main information of the original article if they draw a new article, on the condition that they give a clear reference to the medium they are referring. Media should not publish the whole published material from other publishers, without prior permission of the first publisher. There is an exception for this rule when the publisher provides with clause or any other way that the published material can be republished without asking for permission. Media should not take photographs or videos from other medium without prior permission of the first publisher. In all cases of republishing, media are obliged to cite the first publisher of the content.</p>
<ol start=""6"">
<li><strong>Protection of sources</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The journalists are obliged to save the identity of their sources, apart when the courts require the opposite. The journalists are not required in any way to reveal their sources in the cases that deal with complaints on defamation and insult. </p>
<p>The court can require from the defendant to reveal the relevant information in order to define the truthfulness of the published content, however without identifying the source. </p>
<p><strong>Defamation</strong> implies publication of a false fact or declaration, for which the publisher knows or ought to have known that this fact or declaration was false and the meaning of it damages the reputation of another person. </p>
<p><strong>Insult</strong> implies the statement, behaviour and publication of the declaration toward a person which is humiliating.</p>
<ol start=""7"">
<li><strong>Right of reply</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If media find that they have published an article that contains false facts, they will publish the correction in the nearest time. If media find that they have published an incorrect article, which has risked the reputation of any person or institution, they will apologize in the nearest time. Media will draw the publication of correction, reaction or refutation in a visible place on newspapers' pages, or in the page set by their editorial office for their publication. If the answer or reaction is not convenient for publication, the changes that the editorial office requires will be discussed with the sender. If they do not reach an agreement, then it is advisable to publish the main content of the response, omitting inappropriate parts (insults, defamation, etc) that are in compliance with Press Code of Kosovo. If it is not possible to publish the statements of both pairs in the same article, then the one that has not been published for different reasons will be done as soon as possible. Media will publish the comment of the other part as well.</p>
<ol start=""8"">
<li><strong>Differences between informative and advertising content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Advertisements in the pages of print media, which are paid by sponsors, should certainly be distinguished from informative content and should be published in the way that the reader can differ them as such. Media and journalists have to be careful to distinguish professional reporting from advertisements in order to avoid any conflict of interest.</p>
<h3>GUIDELINES FOR ONLINE JOURNALISM</h3>
<p>These guides for online journalism are integral parts of Guidance of Press Code, which principles are also valid for online journalism. These guides deal with the content of comments and reactions written by public which are posted in media and news agencies' pages based in internet.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Editorial offices can choose to edit or to delete readers' comments before or after they publish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editing before publication – Editorial offices should monitor their websites and should avoid publication of contents that incite, in any way, denigrating language, hate speech or criminal acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editing after publication – Editorial offices that publish unedited comments should offer a possibility of the request to omit or edit comments that contain denigrating language, hate speech or criminal acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The editorial office should not publish articles or comments that incite or cause direct or indirect discrimination on gender, sexual orientation, age, civil status, language, physical impairment or mental limitations, nation, political opinions or beliefs, religion or belief, ethnic or social bases, race, property, origin or other statuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online forums that deal with children and minors should be monitored with a special care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a clear distinction between online media articles and forums reserved for readers' text (columns, opinions, comments, public and editorial reactions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before publication, the content of news is proceeded by editor or editorial group according to standard rules of verification of sources. Editorial office is responsible for what is being published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In discussion forums, comments are responsibility of the authors that write them and then of the medium that publishes them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended that readers who comment should be identifiable.</p>

"55_ZA";"South Africa";"ZA";"The Press Code of Ethics and Conduct for South African Print and Online Media";"<h1>The Press Code of Ethics and Conduct for South African Print and Online Media</h1>
<p>The Press Council of South Africa and the Interactive Advertising Bureau South Africa adopt the following Code for print and online media (together referred to as 'the media).</p>
<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>The media exist to serve society. Their freedom provides for independent scrutiny of the forces that shape society, and is essential to realising the promise of democracy. It enables citizens to make informed judgments on the issues of the day, a role whose centrality is recognised in the South African Constitution.</p>
<p>Section 16 of the Bill of Rights sets out that:</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes:</p>
<p>a) Freedom of the press and other media;
b) Freedom to receive and impart information or ideas;
c) Freedom of artistic creativity; and
d) Academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.</p>
<p>The right in subsection (1) does not extend to:
a) Propaganda for war;
b) Incitement of imminent violence; or
c) Advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.</p>
<p>The media strive to hold these rights in trust for the country's citizens; and they are subject to the same rights and duties as the individual. Everyone has the duty to defend and further these rights, in recognition of the struggles that created them: the media, the public and government, who all make up the democratic state.</p>
<p>The media's work is guided at all times by the public interest, understood to describe information of legitimate interest or importance to citizens.</p>
<p>As journalists we commit ourselves to the highest standards, to maintain credibility and keep the trust of the public. This means always striving for truth, avoiding unnecessary harm, reflecting a multiplicity of voices in our coverage of events, showing a special concern for children and other vulnerable groups, and exhibiting sensitivity to the cultural customs of their readers and the subjects of their reportage, and acting independently.</p>
<p><strong>Application of the Press Code</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This Code applies to the following content published by members:
all content that is published in a printed edition;</p>
<p>all content that is published on a website operated by a member;</p>
<p>all content that is published on a social media account operated by a member; and</p>
<p>all content that is created by a member and published on any platform that is available on the world wide web (i.e. online) or in digital format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All content published by a member through one or more of the platforms mentioned in 1 must comply with the Code, regardless of whether the content is in written, video, audio, pictorial or any other form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members must ensure that when they share content created by a third party through their social media accounts (for example by retweeting) they do so in a manner that is compliant with this Code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members must develop their own social media policies, guided by this Code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Chapter 1: MEDIA-GENERATED CONTENT AND ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p><strong>1. Gathering and reporting of news</strong></p>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>take care to report news truthfully, accurately and fairly;</li>
<li>present news in context and in a balanced manner, without any intentional or negligent departure from the facts whether by distortion, exaggeration or misrepresentation, material omissions, or summarization;</li>
<li>present only what may reasonably be true as fact; opinions, allegations, rumours or suppositions shall be presented clearly as such;</li>
<li>obtain news legally, honestly and fairly, unless public interest dictates otherwise;</li>
<li>use personal information for journalistic purposes only;</li>
<li>identify themselves as such, unless public interest or their safety dictates otherwise;</li>
<li>verify the accuracy of doubtful information, if practicable; if not, this shall be stated;</li>
<li>seek, if practicable, the views of the subject of critical reportage in advance of publication, except when they might be prevented from reporting, or evidence destroyed, or sources intimidated. Such a subject should be afforded reasonable time to respond; if unable to obtain comment, this shall be stated;</li>
<li>state where a report is based on limited information, and supplement it once new information becomes available;</li>
<li>make amends for presenting inaccurate information or comment by publishing promptly and with appropriate prominence a retraction, correction, explanation or an apology on every platform where the original content was published, such as the member's website, social media accounts or any other online platform; and ensure that every journalist or freelancer employed by them who shared content on their personal social media accounts also shares any retraction, correction, explanation or apology relating to that content on their personal social media accounts;</li>
<li>prominently indicate when content that was published online has been amended or an apology or retraction published. The original content may continue to remain online but a link to the amendment, retraction or apology must be included in every version of the content which remains available online;</li>
<li>not be obliged to remove any content which is not unlawfully defamatory; and</li>
<li>not plagiarise.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Independence and Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>not allow commercial, political, personal or other non-professional considerations to influence reporting, and avoid conflicts of interest as well as practices that could lead readers to doubt the media's independence and professionalism;</li>
<li>not accept any benefit which may influence coverage;</li>
<li>indicate clearly when an outside organization has contributed to the cost of newsgathering; and</li>
<li>keep editorial material clearly distinct from advertising and sponsored events.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Privacy, Dignity and Reputation</strong></p>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>exercise care and consideration in matters involving the private lives of individuals. The right to privacy may be overridden by public interest;</li>
<li>afford special weight to South African cultural customs concerning the protection of privacy and dignity of people who are bereaved and their respect for those who have passed away, as well as concerning children, the aged and the physically and mentally disabled;</li>
<li>exercise care and consideration in matters involving dignity and reputation, which may be overridden only if it is in the public interest and if:
<ol>
<li>the facts reported are true or substantially true; or</li>
<li>the reportage amounts to protected comment based on facts that are adequately referred to and that are either true or reasonably true; or</li>
<li>the reportage amounts to a fair and accurate report of court proceedings, Parliamentary proceedings or the proceedings of any quasi-judicial tribunal or forum; or</li>
<li>it was reasonable for the information to be communicated because it was prepared in accordance with acceptable principles of journalistic conduct; or</li>
<li>the content was, or formed part of, an accurate and impartial account of a dispute to which the complainant was a party;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>not identify rape survivors, survivors of sexual violence which includes sexual intimidation and harassment[^1] or disclose the HIV / AIDS status of people without their consent and, in the case of children, from their legal guardian or a similarly responsible adult as well as from the child (taking into consideration the evolving capacity of the child), and a public interest is evident, and it is in the best interests of the child.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Protection of Personal Information[^2]</strong></p>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information under their control is protected from misuse, loss, and unauthorized access;</li>
<li>ensure that the personal information they gather is accurate, reasonably complete and up to date;</li>
<li>take steps to verify the accuracy of their information and, if necessary, amend it where a person requests a correction to be made to his or her personal information;</li>
<li>only disclose sufficient personal information to identify the person being reported on as some information, such as addresses, may enable others to intrude on their privacy and safety; and</li>
<li>inform the affected person(s) and take reasonable steps to mitigate any prejudicial effects where it is reasonably suspected that an unauthorized person may have obtained access to personal information held by the media.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Discrimination and Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>avoid discriminatory or denigratory references to people's race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth or other status, and not refer to such status in a prejudicial or pejorative context – and shall refer to the above only where it is strictly relevant to the matter reported, and if it is in the public interest; and</li>
<li>
<p>balance their right and duty to report and comment on all matters of legitimate public interest against the obligation not to publish material that amounts to propaganda for war, incitement of imminent violence or hate speech – that is, advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.</p>
<p><strong>6. Advocacy</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The media may strongly advocate their own views on controversial topics, provided that they clearly distinguish between fact and opinion, and not misrepresent or suppress or distort relevant facts.</p>
<p><strong>7. Protected Comment</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The media shall be entitled to comment upon or criticise any actions or events of public interest; and</li>
<li>
<p>Comment or criticism is protected even if it is extreme, unjust, unbalanced, exaggerated and prejudiced, as long as it is without malice, is on a matter of public interest, has taken fair account of all material facts that are either true or reasonably true, and is presented in a manner that it appears clearly to be comment.</p>
<p><strong>8. Children</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the spirit of Section 28.2 of the Bill of Rights[^3] the media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>exercise exceptional care and consideration when reporting about children[^4]. If there is any chance that coverage might cause harm of any kind to a child, he or she shall not be interviewed, photographed or identified without the consent of a legal guardian or of a similarly responsible adult and the child (taking into consideration the evolving capacity of the child); and a public interest is evident;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not publish child pornography[^5]; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not identify children who have been victims of abuse or exploitation, or who have been charged with or convicted of a crime, without the consent of their legal guardians (or a similarly responsible adult) and the child (taking into consideration the evolving capacity of the child), a public interest is evident and it is in the best interests of the child.</p>
<p><strong>9. Violence, Graphic Content</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>exercise due care and responsibility when presenting brutality, violence and suffering;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not sanction, promote or glamorise violence or unlawful conduct; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>avoid content which depicts violent crime or other violence or explicit sex, unless the public interest dictates otherwise – in which case a prominently displayed warning must indicate that such content is graphic and inappropriate for certain audiences such as children</p>
<p><strong>10. Headlines, Captions, Posters, Pictures and Video / Audio Content</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headlines, captions to pictures and posters shall not mislead the public and shall give a reasonable reflection of the contents of the report or picture in question; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictures and video / audio content shall not misrepresent or mislead nor be manipulated to do so.</p>
<p><strong>11. Confidential and Anonymous Sources</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The media shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>protect confidential sources of information – the protection of sources is a basic principle in a democratic and free society;</li>
<li>avoid the use of anonymous sources unless there is no other way to deal with a story, and shall take care to corroborate such information; and</li>
<li>
<p>not publish information that constitutes a breach of confidence, unless the public interest dictates otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>12. Payment for Information</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The media shall avoid shady journalism in which informants are paid to induce them to give the information, particularly when they are criminals – except where the material concerned ought to be published in the public interest and the payment is necessary for this to be done.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: USER-GENERATED CONTENT AND ACTIVITIES[^6]:</h3>
<p><strong>13. Principles</strong></p>
<p>The media:</p>
<ol>
<li>are not obliged to moderate all user-generated content (UGC) in advance;</li>
<li>shall have a UGC Policy, consistent with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, governing moderation and/or removal of UGC or user profiles posted;</li>
<li>may remove any UGC or user profile in accordance with their policy;</li>
<li>must make their policy publicly available and set out clearly the:
<ol>
<li>authorisation process, if any, which would-be users must follow, as well as any terms, conditions and indemnity clauses during such registration process;</li>
<li>content which shall be prohibited; and</li>
<li>manner in which the public may inform them of prohibited content;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>should, where practicable, place a notice on the platforms to discourage the posting of prohibited content;</li>
<li>should inform the public that UGC is posted directly by users, and does not necessarily reflect their views;</li>
<li>shall encourage users to report content which may violate the provisions of their policy; and</li>
<li>
<p>shall particularly carefully monitor online forums directed at children.</p>
<p><strong>14. Prohibited Content</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Material constitutes prohibited content if it is expressly not allowed in a member's UGC Policy, and in Section 5.2 of this Code (which refers to Section 16 of the Bill of Rights, and overrules anything to the contrary contained in a UGC policy).</p>
<p><strong>15. Defence</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is a defence for the media to show that they did not author or edit the content complained of;</li>
<li>However, where a complainant has sent a written notice to the particular media, identifying the content concerned, specifying where it was posted, and motivating why it is prohibited (see Clause 14); the media must then either:
<ol>
<li>remove the relevant UGC as soon as possible and notify the complainant accordingly; or</li>
<li>decide not to remove the UGC and notify the complainant accordingly. In the latter case, the complainant may complain to the Press Ombud, who will treat it as if the UGC was posted by the member itself.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>
[^1]: The World Health Organisation inter alia defines sexual violence as follows: 'Sexual violence encompasses acts that range from verbal harassment to forced penetration, and an array of types of coercion, from social pressure and intimidation to physical force…'

</p>
<p>
[^5]: Child Pornography is defined in the Film and Publications Act as: 'Any visual image or any description of a person, real or simulated, however created, who is or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, explicitly depicting such a person who is or who is being depicted as engaged or participating in sexual conduct; engaged in an explicit display of genitals; participating in or assisting another person to participate in sexual conduct which, judged within context, has as its predominant objective purpose, the stimulation of sexual arousal in its target audience or showing or describing the body or parts of the body of the person in a manner or circumstance which, in context, amounts to sexual exploitation.'
</p>
<p>
[^6]: This section applies where a complaint is brought against a member in respect of comments and content posted by users on all platforms in controls and on which it distributes its content.

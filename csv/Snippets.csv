"777";"17_ES";"Node2";"Appendix B: Advice about Internet nThe principles of journalistic ethics are common for all media and formats without any distinction. However, the characteristics of the Internet have led to an extensive casuistry that raises new ethical considerations for the professional practice. n01. Publishers responsibility nThe ethical regulations must rule especially the web pages that are the electronic version of existing publications in other formats, or those who, born on the web, have a header and a content that could be perceived as informative publications. nÃ‚Â» These rules should also concern people who publish on-line information as individuals and can be considered journalism professionals as they receive most part of their income from this activity. nÃ‚Â» This appendix of good practices of information on the Internet affects also journalists who have personal blogs or participate in a professional way in social networks. n02. Transparency and accuracy Ã‚Â» The informative product must be recognisable as such, regardless of its formal nature. The distinction between information and opinion is also required, as well as the differentiation between advertising and information. nÃ‚Â» The information must be credited and the links should contain the correct references, with the purpose of guiding the recipients and keeping the data contextualized. nÃ‚Â» As in other media, the immediacy is no excuse to omit deontological principles as resorting to reliable sources and verifying the information. nÃ‚Â» The information that is been spread through social networks should not contain hearsay nor value judgements that could be offensive. n9 n03 Appendixes Code of ethics n03. Active participation and supervision Active audience participation enriches the plurality of media content on the Internet and is one of the most innovative defining keys of the new informative universe. However, the characteristics of the network generate new ethical traps on the relationship between the media and the public. nÃ‚Â» Feedback from users to the news disclosed on informative websites should be moderated by responsible publishers. These should count with mechanisms and appropriate tools to prevent the dissemination of offensive messages which could violate the dignity of the people and social groups or stimulate discrimination, violence and hatred. nÃ‚Â» The contributions on the Internet should not be anonymous. The diffuser should require a prior registration for users who wish to comment and give their opinions, in the same way that newspapers don't publish letters to the editor written by people who have not been properly identified. Anonymity is admissible when it tries to ensure information on facts and opinions of unequivocal public interest or vital need, but the participant must be equally identified in front of the medium. n04. Continuance of documents on-line The indefinite continuance on the web of documents and audiovisual materials could produce undesirable or uncomfortable situations for the people affected, either if they are information sources or witnesses. In the case that they ask for erasure of the data, the requirement should reconcile the public interest with the individual rights. In any case, the invocation of the right to oblivion should not be reason for the immediate destruction of items that in some ways are part of a general archive or living memory which is a collective heritage and eventually may be of interest to historians and social researchers. n10 nColÃ‚Â·legi de Periodistes de Catalunya nÃ‚Â» As a general rule, the claim for destruction of online-traces on behalf of individuals or legal entities should not be accepted obligatory when they allege simple reasons as a change of opinion or image, or other strictly personal considerations. nÃ‚Â» However, the persistence of certain documents should not generate abusive or harmful situations at the expense of the fundamental rights of the person. nÃ‚Â» Consequently, the responsible publishers should prevent or palliate the possible damages caused to people who have given their testimony (image, voice or documentation), due to the singular fact of the continuity, the ease of access and the reproduction and manipulation of the materials present on the internet. This attitude must be especially prudent when the affected are children or young people in a situation of defencelessness or risk against the possible use of their presence on the Internet. nÃ‚Â» In any case, the very nature of the web as a global and permanent stock with all kind of contents of universal access makes it practically unfeasible to remove discretionarily, systematically, instantly and extensively materials considered improper or harmful to individuals, companies or institutions. n05. Authorship and plagiarism Ã‚Â» The recognition of intellectual authorship and all kinds of derived rights must be respected on the Internet in the same way as on any other informative format. The ease of copy and paste provided by those digital products, becoming a daily written and mechanical practice, should never be a pretext for plagiarism and usurpation."

"793";"17_ES";"Node5_14_03";"Appendix C: Advice on plagiarism nThe criterion 1 of the Code urges to check all the information, while the criterion 5 recommends, as a general rule, to quote the sources. These performance standards are the basis of the credibility of journalists, and their meticulous compliance depends greatly on the confidence of the public. nPlagiarism means the reproduction without any credits of a significant part of somebody elses work. Doing so may constitute a crime, but it can also severely undermine the credibility of a journalist or a news medium. nThere are various forms of plagiarism, all of them detestable, although with different degrees of severity: nÃ‚Â» the literal reproduction of an extract of a literary work, a journalistic work or any other document of which the authorship is identifiable and provable. nÃ‚Â» the reproduction of photographs or images of any kind that have authorship, even though if they are not subjected to copyright. nÃ‚Â» the reuse of extracts of interviews or recordings that were obtained by journalists from other media and that could have been copied from broadcasts of someone else. nAlthough the reproduction is not literal, disseminating information without quoting the other medium that obtained and spread it first can also be judged as plagiarism. The citation is particularly required in the case of a scoop or highly relevant information that other media obtained from sources that were only available to them. nWhen the credits of the origin of the information are well expressed or when it has been obtained directly from the same source or multiple sources, it cannot be considered as plagiarism."

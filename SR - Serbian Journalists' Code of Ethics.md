# SERBIAN JOURNALISTS’ CODE OF ETHICS

Serbian Journalists’ Code of Ethics was adopted in 2006 by the Independent Journalists’ Association of Serbia and the Journalists’ Association of Serbia. The journalist associations amended the Code in 2013 adding provisions regarding the prevention of corruption and conflict of interest. The journalist associations owe special thanks to the publishers of the previous three editions of the Code, Konrad Adenauer Foundation Belgrade and the Council of Europe, for their contribution to strengthening media self-regulation and improving ethical standards of free and independent journalism.

### PREAMBLE

Journalists′ Association of Serbia and Independent Journalists′ Association of Serbia adopt this Code as an ethical standard for professional conduct of journalists. 

It is journalists’ duty to follow ethical and professional principles contained in the Code, and to resist pressures to violate these principles.

The Code recommends solidarity with colleagues when the journalists’ professional conduct and standards are endangered.

*Explanation:*

Professional and ethical standards defined in the Code aspire to improve the reputation of the journalistic profession, promote commitment to freedom of thought, speech and expression, as well as the independence of the media. 

Journalists who violate the principles of this Code cannot count on unconditional support of journalists’ associations and their colleagues. 

The media are obliged to place above all other interests, the interest of the public, providing comprehensive, timely and truthful informing. In the context of this Code, the public interest includes publishing all important information which is helpful to the reader/listener/viewer in forming their judgment/opinion regarding various phenomena and events.

Editors and publishers are responsible for the application of this Code.

Journalists, that is editors, are professionally accountable to the public (readers/viewers/listeners), and not the publisher/owner (the state and interest groups), and their private, economic, political and other interests.

A publisher/an owner has an indisputable right to earn a profit and use it as a guideline in media management. At the same time, the purpose of the media is the public interest, and ownership rights must not violate it. Business, political and private interests of a publisher/an owner must not be an excuse or justification for violation of this Code.

A publisher/an owner should not alter the editorial policy of the media at his own discretion, without the consent of the editorial board.

A publisher has the right to define editorial policy, but it must not be in conflict with the law or with the professional code.

### V JOURNALISTS′ ATTENTIONA

1. A journalist is obliged to approach their work with due professional care.

Guidelines:

- In contact with sources of information a special care is required to avoid real or apparent inclination, arising out of close personal relationships.
- Readers/viewers/listeners must be notified regarding direct benefits that the source can achieve from publishing said information. If the source has a direct interest, or is trying to deal with someone, readers/viewers/listeners must be informed.

3. Keeping secret the facts that might significantly affect the public perception of an event is equal to their deliberate distortion or lying.

Guidelines:

- If the sources of information are spokespersons of political parties, individuals and companies, this information must be indicated because of the possibility of their direct or indirect impact on objectivity of reporting.

### VI RELATION TO THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION

1. A journalist has the right to investigate all circumstances and facts regarding the events that are of public interest.

2. While collecting information a journalist must not use extortion, threats and persecution against the source of information. 

Guidelines:

- Besides the fact that they must not threaten the sources of information, journalists should not promise a favourable coverage in exchange for information.

3. A journalist is obliged to respect a request for anonymity from the source of information. Inventing anonymous sources is a serious offense to the standards of journalists’ professional conduct.
   
 Guidelines:
 -  Using anonymous (confidential) sources of information is generally not recommended, unless there is no other way to acquire the information which is deemed to be of utmost importance to the public.
 -  Often, the use of unnamed sources of information is only the way for the source or a journalist/media to present inaccurate, incomplete or insufficiently verified information. In case it transpires that hiding the source is used to cover their absence, the credibility of journalists/media will be seriously undermined.
 -  Anonymity/confidentiality should be provided for the sources that can provide “first hand”, information, that is, documents that directly confirm or, by itself, represent information of great public importance.
 -  An editor is required to check with the journalist the justification for the use of anonymous (confidential) sources of information. Regarding this, it is necessary that at least one editor knows and protects the identity of an anonymous source. 
 -  If the source of information requests from the journalist that their identity remain confidential even to the editor, this request should be rejected.
    
4. A journalist is obliged to present themself to a source of information and name a media they work for at that moment, except if doing differently is in the public interest and when it is done in accordance with the rules set out in this Code.

Guidelines:

- False impersonation and false identification of the media a journalist works for is not permitted. Journalists on assignment must not present themselves as persons who have special powers, business people or “ordinary citizens”.
- Concealing the identity of a journalist can be used only as the final means to obtain information: if other methods have been unsuccessfully applied, if the information cannot be obtained in any other way, and only when it relates to information of great importance to the public.
- In case of concealing the journalists’ identity, it is necessary that the editorial board is informed, and it is recommended to consult legal advisors for possible legal consequences.

5. At the request of an editor a journalist may tell them the identity of a source who wishes to remain anonymous, and the editor is obliged to protect the anonymity of the source. 

 Guidelines:
 -  If a source of information is unnamed, the editor must be informed of the identity of the source, since both, journalists and editors are responsible for the accuracy of the information published.
 -  A journalist has the right not to disclose the identity of an anonymous (confidential) source to the editor. In this case, the editor may decide not to publish the information obtained from a source unknown to them, and this procedure shall not be considered censorship and is in accordance with the Code.

6. Juveniles, as a rule, may be interviewed only in the presence of, or with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.

7. A journalist must never abuse the emotions of other people, their ignorance or lack of judgement.

Guidelines:

- Sources of information with which journalists converse are not always aware of the power of the media and the consequences that their statements may have on them personally, as well as on people they are talking about. Conscious abuse is incompatible with journalism, as well as  inattention whose possible consequence could be abuse of the collocutor.

2. A journalist must not unjustly create fear among people or instill false hopes.

Guidelines:

- A journalist who deliberately encourages unfounded fears and hopes of readers/viewers/listeners, especially because of the “attractiveness” of the text/report, violates the Code in the most extreme manner.

1. A journalist respects the privacy, dignity and integrity of the people they write about. The right to privacy is narrowed when public figures are in question, especially public officials. 
   
Guidelines:
-  When reporting on accidents and crimes, publishing the names and photographs of victims and perpetrators that clearly identify them is not permitted. Also, publishing any information which could indirectly reveal the identity of either victim, or the perpetrator, before the relevant authority officially
announces is not allowed.
-  A journalist must have an awareness of the power of media, or the possible consequences for the victim or the perpetrator, if their identity is disclosed. They must take into account, in particular, the weight of the possible consequences in case of any errors/incorrect assumptions in reporting.
-  Even if the relevant state authorities publish information which are in the domain of privacy of the perpetrator or the victim, the media must not transmit that information. The error of the state authorities does not imply “permission” for the violation of ethical principles of the profession.
-  Public figures are aware in advance that their right to privacy is somewhat limited, but this does not mean that the media can violate it without any reason or explanation.
-  Data from the private lives of public figures are published only if it is in the public interest, or if they have a direct impact on a number of people, if they are in contradiction with the spirit of the function which that person performs, or ideas that the person publicly advocates.
-  In case of death of a public figure, the media must be particularly careful with the information which subsequently associates that person with an offense or discriminatory information. Even when it comes to information of public importance, a journalist must be aware that the deceased persons are legally released from further prosecution.
    
2. Journalists and editors should especially avoid speculations and transmitting insufficiently verifiable attitudes in reporting on accidents and tragedies which have resulted in deaths or when the financial and other interests of the citizens are severely affected.

3. When reporting on events involving personal pain and shock, a journalist is obliged to adapt their questions so that they reflect the spirit of compassion and discretion.

Guidelines:
-  Representatives of the state and public institutions working in child protection are sometimes unaware of the way media function and their wider impact. The information that they provide to journalists often involves disclosure of the identity of juveniles. A journalist must not abuse their good intentions or ignorance. Information received from doctors, social workers, teachers, and so on, which directly or indirectly refers to the identity of juveniles, must not be published.



### VIII UTILISING HONOURABLE MEANS

1. While collecting information, photos, documents, audio and video a journalist will only utilise honourable means. 

Guidelines:

- Journalists and editors must not publish material acquired by using hidden cameras, listening devices, or unauthorised wiretapping, except when the public interest is protected (for example: disclosure of information regarding the threat to life and health of the population, corruption, abuse of power, etc.). 
- For the application of this exception there must be a clearly defined and transparent editorial procedure. 
- Gathering information by bribing sources is incompatible with journalism.

2. A journalist should not continue asking questions, phoning, photographing or recording a private person after they were asked to stop.

3. Pressure on a private person to answer any questions can be continued after the rejection, but only on condition that there is a grounded public interest at stake.

4. A journalist has the right, in relation to the state and other institutions, to continually ask questions that they believe are of public interest, regardless of whether they are asked to stop or not.



### IX RESPECTING AUTHORSHIP

1. Media and journalists respect and application of current legislation on copyright. When permission for reproduction from another source is received, this is done with respect for the author and with naming the source.

- Photomontage and processed photographs must be clearly marked and differentiated from documentary photography. The readers/viewers must not be deliberately misled.

3. A journalist should refuse to sign the text, photograph, drawing, illustration, audio, or video:

- when it is changed by the editorial, proofreading or other interference, so that its meaning is changed, and if such changes are contrary to the opinion and belief of the journalist, 
- in case when a journalist has a reasonable interest (personal security, etc.).

Guidelines:

 - A journalist should not be undersigned if they did not participate in the preparation and production of the texts, photographs, drawings, illustrations, audio and video recordings.

4. An editor is obliged to hear the request of a journalist not to sign the text, photograph, drawings, illustration, audio, or video recordings if the journalist believes that it would endanger their safety.

## CSV updated on 2022-03-04

Each ethical code is stored in the database under a Markdown or a HTML format.

The folder CSV contains the latests versions of the tables.

Tip for updating: double quotes must not be used, use simple quotes instead; use straight quotes instead of curly ones; separate each numbered line with a blank line; paragraph lines must not be broken (the highlight system used in front-end is JavaScript based and very sensitive). Any mofication has potential effects on the snippets: if they are not identical to the related ethical codes, the highlighting will not work.

### Snippets

Snippets and codes must match perfectly. A space is considered a character. Use simple straight quoted instead of curly or double quotes. No titles, no numbers, and no styled words (meaning no bold or italic). In any cases, pay attention to prevent invisible characters (BOM).

# Code of Ethics for Journalists

## Introduction

The Code of Ethics is a self-regulating instrument which aims to guide, strengthen and improve the quality of journalism and the sense of responsibility of journalists in Albania.

The principles of this Code are in line with the universal ethical values of journalism, which are widely recognized and accepted by media organizations and journalism unions in democratic countries. They are a cornerstone of democratic pluralism and also respect the spirit of the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

## The Role of Media in Society

Freedom of speech, freedom of information and criticism, freedom of the press, and access to official documents are basic elements of a democratic society.

Media play an extraordinarily important role in society, by providing reliable and timely news and information in various forms and through assorted platforms. The media serve as watchdogs, holding centers of power to account and constantly monitoring government authorities and organizations, institutions and businesses. Media play a fundamental role in the democratic processes and provide ample opportunities and a safe environment to allow journalists to perform their duties independently.

The media recognize the importance of pluralism in society and respect the diversity of opinions, opposing all discrimination based on sex, race, nationality, language, religion, ideology, culture, class, conviction, or any other cause.

The media recognize and defend both its rights and duties versus the public, constantly preserving the balance between them.

## The Scope of the Code

The following regulations concerning conduct shall apply to all persons and organizations engaging in the gathering, editing, preparation and dissemination of journalistic information. The scope of the Code shall cover the individual and collective supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.

The Code refers to individual and collective responsibilities in the supply of information performed in the field of printed (text and photography) and electronic media.

The principles of this Code apply equally to all media and journalistic platforms, offline and online, including journalism disseminated through social media and internet portals.

The Code of Ethics presumes and expects that all media organizations and journalists recognize and accept the voluntary principles set out in this Code. All those who engage in journalism are invited to acknowledge and accept the following principles as necessary to the well-being of journalism and freedom of expression in Albania.

Journalists who knowingly violate the principles of this code betray the trust of the public and may not expect the support and solidarity of their colleagues, media organizations or journalism trade unions. Controversies arising from alleged violations of the Code are dealt with through transparent systems of voluntary self-regulation developed by journalists and news media organizations that may operate at the level of the enterprise and across different platforms of the news media industry.

### 1. Accuracy and Fairness of Information

   Journalists have the right to seek information and the right of access to public information. They have the right to publish and to criticize.

   Journalists and news media shall at all times strive to publish information that is to the best of their knowledge truthful, balanced and verified.

   **Accuracy**
   
   A journalist must verify information prior to its publication in order to ensure that it is accurate, fact-based and trustworthy. All data and information must be subject to careful scrutiny: whether it is obtained from human sources or documents.

   Journalists should always indicate where information has not been confirmed.

   Media should not mislead the public. They should clearly indicate where manipulated texts, documents, images and sounds have been used.

   Media shall not publish any photos, image, audio, or visual arrangements that distort the ideas or facts of the source, with the exception of caricatures, cartoons or comic plots.

   **Unbiased Journalism**
   
   Journalists shall strive to provide unbiased and balanced reporting. Journalists shall refer to all available sources and interested parties that can provide useful and relevant information.
   In reporting on a controversy, journalists should be inclusive and seek to ensure that all parties concerned have an opportunity to state their position.
   Criticized parties shall have the right to respond to accusations, whenever possible in the same publication. Journalists shall make every effort to contact all sides and gather all relevant opinions. Mere contacts with both sides do not “release” a journalist from the obligation to present both sides of a story, and to report as truthfully as possible.
   The principle of “presenting all sides” may not apply in publications representing personal opinions (editorials, opinion pieces) as well as reports of a factual nature, such as reporting on public meetings or events.

### 2. Distinguishing Fact from Opinion

   Media must distinguish clearly between opinion and comments and fact-based reporting. Columnist, caricaturists, and critics are allowed to present their opinions on individuals and events.

   News relates to information supported by facts and data, while an opinion piece contains and represents ideas, opinions and considerations of journalists, editors and publishers.

### 3.  Rectification and Reply

   Media shall be open to engage with their audience and to deal with legitimate comments and complaints.

   Media should publish a clear and appropriately prominent correction when it can be demonstrated that inaccurate or misleading information has been published. Media should provide an apology and appropriate remedy where it is necessary.

   A criticized party shall always have the right of response.

   If the reply is not fit for publication as such, changes to it should be discussed with the writer. If he or she cannot be contacted within a reasonable time, the reply may be published in amended form. However, its essential contents must not be changed.

### 4. Relations with Sources

   Journalists shall strive to gather information from all available sources in order to provide accurate, complete, and impartial information.

   Journalists shall be transparent in their work and use methods for gathering information that are ethical and lawful.

   A person being interviewed has the right to know in which medium and in what connection statements will be used.

   Journalists shall exercise care in the selection of sources and establish clear working relations with them to make sure that the information they receive is correct.

   Media shall exercise particular care in dealing with sources who are members of vulnerable groups, such as children and young people, victims of violence or minorities.

   Media shall not distort or misuse statements made in a specific context. In particular consideration should be shown towards people who cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have.

   Journalists shall not divulge the name of a person when information is provided on a confidential basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.

   The right to the anonymity may be broken only if:

   a) There is suspicion that the source consciously has distorted truth or is seeking to manipulate media for personal gain;
  
  b) The reference to the name of the source is the only way to avoid serious and inevitable damage to others;
  
  c) The information in question relates to the planning of a serious criminal act or is of major concern for public welfare.

   If unjustly denied access to requested information, a journalist has the right to inform the general public about it.


### 5. Editorial independence

   Media shall avoid unacceptable conflicts of interest and shall not permit any undue influence arising from personal beliefs, political or financial incentives to affect the accurate and impartial reporting of their journalists and work of editorial departments.

   Journalists, publishers, and media owners must resist threats, provocations, or incentives to influence, distort or conceal information. They shall not use any information or data collected during their job for their own personal benefit.

   Editorial content should be clearly distinguished from marketing, advertisements, materials prepared by political parties or other institutions/organizations, or sponsored content. Sponsored content must clearly show the identity of the sponsor.

   Commercial and political advertising, as well as sponsored content – including articles and supplements – shall be labeled accordingly to ensure the media audience can distinguish them from editorial content.

### 6. Pre-publication Agreement

   Journalists who agree not to publish a piece of information or material for a given period of time must respect these arrangements. Such an agreement (embargo) should be considered null and void if the information is published by another party, or when the person who requested the embargo in any way violates terms and conditions of the agreement reached between parties.

   In the interests of fairness and accuracy journalists may show their news stories to interested parties prior to publication, but they shall not grant a veto on the right to publish and shall be free to decide for themselves on what suggestions they should take under consideration.

### 7. Liability after Publication

   The publisher and editor are liable and responsible for the publication of news articles as well as letters to the editor, comments and replies published on the media website including where the name of the author is omitted or signed under an alias.

   Media and editorial staff should agree to and publish clearly defined terms and conditions for the selection and publishing of comments from the public. Media shall monitor and review such comments and take steps to ensure the terms and conditions of publication are respected.

   Media have the right to add a “note” on comments and replies, or even decide not to publish them at all, with the exception of cases when it has previously promised to publish such comments. The editorial staff reserves the right to edit or shorten letters to the editor, or comments, provided that the editing does not alter their meaning. If the media organization were to decide to publish a letter to the editor or comment, it should do so within a reasonable amount of time between the moment it was submitted and the time of publishing.

   Prior to publishing a comment, or a letter to the editor, where there is a suggestion that it contains serious accusations against a third party, the editorial staff, or the editor, shall investigate if there is any basis to these accusations. Also, the accused party must be afforded the opportunity to respond.

   It may not realistically be expected that all comments be read, edited, or rejected prior to publication.

Where there is a complaint that a comment includes serious accusations or insults directed at a third party, the editorial staff and the editors shall investigate whether there is any basis to such accusations, and, if so, the comment must be removed from publication.

   Journalists will use fair methods in the collection of information. They only make use of subterfuge, hidden cameras, microphones or other special equipment, or obscure their professional identity, in circumstances where:

   b) The information is of urgent and serious concern to the public

   Public figures are entitled to less privacy than other individuals. However, information on their private lives and information related to their family and friends should be disclosed only when it serves the public interest. Public officers are also justified in not disclosing their private life except for the cases when their private life may affect their public activity.

- Matters of urgent and immediate concern to public health and safety;
    
- The finding, prevention, and disclosure of serious crimes, scandals, and abuse of power;
    
- Actions to protect the public from the danger of being seriously misled.
    
    
Legitimate public interest does not justify sensationalism and in the spirit of this Code it should never be confused with information that is ‘”interesting to the public”.
    
### 18. Albanian Language

Journalists should respect and carefully observe the rules of the Albanian language. The use of foreign words should be avoided except for clarity of meaning or when appropriate in direct reporting.

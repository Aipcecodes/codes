# Declaration

## Preface

The right to information, together with freedom of  expression and criticism, is one of the fundamental liberties of every  human being.The rights and duties of journalists de- volve from the public's right to have access to fact and opinion.

Journalists' responsibility to the public must come before any they bear towards a third party, notably employers and public authorities.

Journalists should, of their own accord, adopt the rules necessary to accomplish their mission to inform. Such is the object of the  «Declaration of Duties» below.

In order to carry out their journalistic du- ties in an independent  manner, and in ac- cordance with required quality standards, journalists must be able to count on general conditions adequate to the exercise of their profession. Such is the object of the «Declaration of Rights»  that follows.

Journalists see their duty in following the basic  principles of this declaration. While recognising the laws of their  country, journalists only accept the judgment of their professional  colleagues, the Press Council or legitimate organizations of  professional ethics. They reject any interference by the state or other  official bodies. Fair reporting requires at least a short, published  summary of a Press Council decision in relation to one's own media.

## Declaration of Duties of a Journalist
 
The journalist who gathers, selects, edits,  interprets and comments on information is ruled by general principles of fairness in his or her honest treatment of sources (the people with  whom he or she is talking) and the public. The journalist's duties are:

1. To seek out the truth, in the interests of the public's right to know, whatever the consequences to him- or herself.
2. To defend freedom of information, freedom of  commentary and criticism, and the independence and dignity of the  journalistic profession.
3. Not to publish information, documents, images or  sound recordings of which the origin is unknown to the journalist. Not  to suppress information or any essential elements of a story. Not to  misrepresent any text, document, image or sound recording, nor people's  expressed opinions. If information is unconfirmed to clearly say so. To  indicate when photo- graphic and/or sound material has been combined to  make a montage.
4. Not to use dishonest methods to obtain information,  recordings, images or documents. Not to manipulate them, or have them  manipulated by a third party with a view to falsification. To prohibit  plagiarism in not passing off the work or ideas of others as one's own.
5. To rectify any published information that is revealed to be factually incorrect.
6. To respect professional secrecy and not reveal the source of any information obtained in confidence.
7. To respect peoples' privacy in so far as the public  interest does not demand otherwise. To disregard anonymous or unfounded  accusations.
8. In respecting human dignity, the journalist must  avoid any allusion by text, image or sound to a person's ethnic or  national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation as well as to any  illness or physical or mental handicap that could be discriminatory in  character. The reporting of war, acts of terrorism, accidents and  catastrophes by means of text, image and sound should respect the  victims' suffering and the feelings of their loved ones.
9. Not to accept any advantage nor any promise that could limit his or her profes- sional independence or expression of opinion.
10. To avoid as journalists any form of commercial  advertising; and never to accept conditions laid down by advertisers  directly or indirectly.
11. To take journalistic directives only from designated editorial superiors; and to respect those directives only when they are not contrary to this declaration.

## Declaration of Rights of a Journalist

Full respect by journalists of the duties articulated above requires that they enjoy, at the minimum, the following rights:

1. Free access to all sources of information and the  right to investigate without impediment anything that is in the public  interest. Public or private confidentiality can only be invoked against  the journalist in exceptional circumstances and with the provision of  clearly-defined reasons.
2. The right not to act in any way nor express any  opinion that is contrary to professional rules or personal conscience.  As a result, journalists should not suffer any prejudice.
3. The right to refuse any directive or interference  that is contrary to the general policy of the organisation with which he or she is collaborating. This policy must be communicated in writing  before the journalist's employment. It cannot be modified or revoked  unilaterally under pain of breach of contract.
4. The right to transparency as to the ownership of the company for which the journalist works. The right of a member of an  editorial team to be informed in time, and to be heard before, any  decision that affects the future of the company. In particular, members  of the editorial staff must be informed and heard before final decisions determining the com- position or organisation of the editorial  department.
5. The right to adequate and continuous professional training.
6. The right to benefit from work conditions guaranteed by a collective agreement, including the right to be active in  professional organisations without suffering discrimination.
7. The right to benefit from an individual employment contract guaranteeing material and moral security. In particular, an  appropriate remuneration – corresponding to the journalist's function, responsibilities and social role – should ensure his or her economic  independence.

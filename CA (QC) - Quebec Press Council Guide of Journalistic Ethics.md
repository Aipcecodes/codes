# Quebec Press Council Guide of Journalistic Ethics

## Preamble

a) Whereas the free flow of information is one of the most important guarantees of liberty and democracy;

b) Whereas freedom of the press derives from the fundamental freedoms of thought, speech, free expression and opinion, and is widely legally recognized so nationally and internationally, and as such no one must dictate content to news media;

e) Whereas the notion of the public interest is variable to different cultures and eras and this pursuit of the public interest entails journalists' access to privileged information vital to responding to the political, economic, social, and cultural concerns of citizens to allow them informed participation in the life of a democracy;

f) Whereas journalists and news media are first and foremost servants of the public, and the public's right to information supersedes any other considerations regarding editorial choices;

g) Whereas journalists and news media ought in all situations to provide the public with reliable information;

h) Whereas the public's right to information is foundational to journalistic ethics;

i) Whereas, in order to ensure the full exercise of freedom of the press and the public's right to information, the Press Council has been specifically founded to hear public complaints concerning journalistic ethics;

j) Whereas, in order to hear and adjudicate such complaints, the ethical principles guiding journalism must be set down;

k) Whereas the standards set forth in this Guide create first and foremost an obligation of means for journalists and news media;

2. By this Guide, news media are entirely responsible for all journalistic content they choose to publish or broadcast on any given platform or social media account, regardless of the medium used.

## Section C: Pursuing the truth

### 9. Qualitative characteristics of information
Depending on the type of journalism, news and information pieces produced by journalists and news media should possess the following qualities:
a) accuracy: fidelity to the truth;
b) rigorous reasoning;
c) impartiality: providing an unbiased point of view;
d) balance: striving to present all sides of a story;
e) completeness: presenting all the facts and information essential to understanding while preserving editorial freedom.
     
### 10. Types of journalism

1) There are essentially two types of journalism, each with its own ethical requirements: objective reporting and opinion pieces.
2) The public must easily be able to identify which type so as not to be misled in any way.

1. **Factual journalism**
(1) Factual journalism reports facts and events and contextualizes them.
(2) Such information must be accurate, rigorous in its reasoning, impartial, balanced and complete, as defined in article 9 of this Guide.

 2. **Opinion journalism**
(1) In opinion pieces, journalists have great latitude with their choice of tone and style. They may express personal points of view, take sides, and provide criticism, comments and opinions.
(2) Opinion journalists ought to describe the relevant facts on which they base their opinions, unless these facts are already common knowledge. They also have a duty to share their reasoning.
(3) The information reported must be accurate and complete and rooted in rigorous reasoning, as defined in article 9 of this Guide.

### 11. Reliability of information from sources
 
Journalists must take reasonable means to assess the reliability of information from sources in order to ensure the public receives reliable information.

1. **Anonymous sources**
 
2. Journalists may resort to using anonymous sources when the following three conditions are met:
(a) the information is in the public interest
(b) the information cannot be obtained by any other reasonable means
(c) the source may suffer harm if revealed.

### 13. Agreements with a source

1) Journalists must try to respect, by all means at their disposal, any agreement between themselves and a source to whom they have explicitly agreed (confidentiality, off the record, not for attribution, embargo, etc.), unless the source has knowingly deceived them.

2) Journalists may however publish information covered by a confidentiality agreement if they have obtained such information otherwise.

3) Journalists may reveal the identity of a source to a senior editor equally committed to respecting the confidentiality agreement. This is standard journalistic practice and is in no way equivalent to naming a source publicly.

 1. **Sources’ right to review**

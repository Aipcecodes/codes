# Charter of Duties of Journalists 

*Adopted by the National Federation of the Italian Press and National Council Order of Journalists in Rome on 8 July 1993.*

### Introduction

A journalist’s job is based on principles of freedom of information and of opinions. It is confirmed by the Italian Constitution and governed by the second article of the Italian law no. 1969 dated on 3 February 1963.

“Freedom of information and of expression are the inalienable rights of all journalists. They are limited by the observance of the rules of law and subject to the protection of other people’s personality. They always follow all duties set by fealty and good faith. The respect of the truth of facts is an unbreakable duty. All incorrect news must be rectified, and mistakes must be corrected.

Journalists and publishers are obliged to respect professional secrecy on the sources of a piece of information, when it is required by the fiduciary character of them; they have to promote the spirit of collaboration between colleagues, the co-operation between journalists and publishers, and the trust in press and in readers.”

The relationship of trust between information organs and the people is the foundation of every journalists’ job. To promote and cement this relationship, all Italian journalists sign the following Ethics Code (Carta de Doveri).

### Principles

A journalist has to respect, cultivate and defend the right of information for all people; for these reasons he researches and diffuses every piece of information that he considers of public interest in observance of truth and accuracy.

A journalist researches and spreads news of public interest in spite of the obstacles which can arise in his work; he makes any effort to guarantee to people knowledge and control of all public documents.

A journalist’s responsibility towards people always prevails above any other thing. A journalist can never subordinate his responsibility to other people’s interest and particularly to the publishers’ interest, governments’ interest or of the other organizations of the State.

A journalist has to respect people, his dignity and his right of secrecy, and he never discriminates between people according to their race, their religion, their sex, their mental and physical condition, or their political views.

A journalist rectifies, swiftly and accurately, his mistakes or his imprecisions in conformity with the duty to rectify and with what is established by law.

A journalist always respects the right of presumption of innocence.

A journalist has to observe the professional secrecy, when it is required by the fiduciary character of his sources. In any other cases a journalist has to respect the transparency of the sources.

A journalist can not adhere to secret associations or act in any way in conflict with the eighteenth article of the Italian Constitution.

A journalist cannot accept benefits, favours or tasks that make dependent his autonomy and his professional credibility. A journalist cannot omit facts or essential details for a complete reconstruction of events. Titles, summaries, photos and subtitles must not either distort reality or change the content of articles and news.

A journalist must not publish images and photos of people involved in daily episodes particularly terrifying, taking care to preserve people’s dignity. Nor must he dwell upon details of violence or brutality, unless there is a pre-eminent reason of social interest. He must not interfere with reality to create artificial images.

Comments and opinions belong to the right of speech and of criticism and, therefore, they have to be absolutely free from any obligation, except for the constraint set by law against offence, defamation and violence against people.

### Duties

**A journalist’s responsibility**

A journalist is responsible for his job towards people. He has to favour their dialogue with the ombudsman. He has to create various instruments (reader’s guarantee, pages for readers, spaces for reply etc.), giving a wide diffusion to their activity.

A journalist only accepts suggestions and instructions from the editorial hierarchy of his newspaper, as long as the dispositions are not against the professional law, against the national Italian journalist’s work contract (CNLG) and are in accordance with the Ethics Code (Carta di Doveri).

Extenuating circumstances, insulting or denigratory references concerning people and their privacy, are only acceptable when they are of relevant public interest.

When a journalist makes a charge against people, he does not spread news damaging a person’s reputation or dignity without giving the opportunity of reply to the person concerned. Should this be impossible (because the person is impossible to find or he doesn’t want to reply) he has to inform the readers and the public of this fact. In any case, before publishing a piece of news concerning the investigations’ warning by a judge, he has to establish whether the charged person is aware of it.

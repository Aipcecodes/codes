   1. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are basic elements of democracy. A free independent press, radio and television are the most important guarantee of the democratic development of the society.
   2. The mass media must defend the freedom of speech and freedom of press. They should not submit to any influence, that can limit the free flow of information and the usage of sources or limit the debate on any issue having significance for society.
   3. The duty of mass media is to protect human rights.

### 2. INTEGRITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

   1. The main task of a journalist is to provide society with true and verified information.
   2. The facts should be set forth objectively and clearly, stressing major links and with no misrepresentations.
   3. A journalist carries a personal responsibility for the information presented and its interpretation.
   4. A journalist should refuse assignments contrary to his/ her convictions.
   5. A journalist must respect intellectual property and not allow plagiarism.

### 3. EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY

   1. As is stated in the Press Law, the editor is responsible for the information presented on radio, on television or in the press. He/ she should guarantee the flow or free and proper information, as well as the free exchange of opinions.
   2. The newsroom should guard their integrity, so that they stay free to act independently of any persons or groups who would like to exercise influence on them.

### 4. RELATIONS WITH SOURCES

   1. A journalist has no right to reveal a source without its permission, except if it is demanded by a court.

   2. In particular, consideration should be shown for people who cannot be expected to know the consequences of the information and statements they give.

      A journalist should care never to take advantage of the emotions and feelings of other people, of their ignorance or their failing power of judgement.

### 5. PUBLICATION RULES

   1. A journalist should be critical in the choice of sources. The information should be checked and statements quoted should be verified.

   3. In the publication, factual information must be clearly and unmistakably separated from comments.

      A photomontage should be marked as such or in the caption of the picture.

   1. A journalist must respect democratic institutions and moral standards.
   2. A journalist should stand up for human values - peace, democracy, human rights, people's rights to self-determination.

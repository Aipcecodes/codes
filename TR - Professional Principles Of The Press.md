## HOW TO APPLY TO THE PRESS COUNCIL?

### APPLICATION AND ASSESSMENT METHODS

The Supreme Board of the Press Council settles the applications of journalists and press organs (written, oral, visual) against whom an accusation is duly made that they have acted contrary to the Professional Principles of the Press.

In order for a matter of violation regarding the Professional Principles of the Press to be handled by the Supreme Board, it is sufficient that any person appropriately applies (by petition, via phone or the Internet) to the Press Council on a matter which s/he deems worthy of complaint. The applications of organizations, which have the authority to represent a certain profession or community, related to relevant sections of the society are also taken into account.

The Secretary-General informs the reporter and the institution of the complaint after receiving the application, and requests a response. S/he tries to reconcile the parties; and if this is not possible, brings the report and the file to the Supreme Board of the Press Council meeting.

The Supreme Board of the Press Council holds a meeting with the participation of at least 11 members and discusses the matter. Decisions are taken by the majority of those present. Each member has one vote. A vote only reflects the opinion of its owner. No-one can abstain during voting. The member of the Supreme Board cannot participate in the negotiations for complaints related to the institution s/he represents, and cannot vote.

The judgment of the Supreme Board of the Press Council are definite. However, an extraordinary appeal could be made within 15 days from the announcement of the decision on the grounds that a material error was made in the first examination or an evidence presented by the complainant and the complainee were not evaluated. A Board consisting of the President, the Vice President and the Secretary-General submit the Report related to the appeal to the Supreme Board. The relevant parties are invited to the Supreme Board’s meeting where the report related to the appeal is discussed. The Supreme Board makes an assessment after hearing the participating parties. The first decision of the Supreme Board can be changed by the votes of at least 2/3 of the participants in the meeting.

At the latest, complaints may cover two months before the date of application. At the latest, the application is settled in two months from the date of the application.

Any matter related to the Supreme Board’s negotiations and voting is confidential unless otherwise decided. If the Board deems it necessary or receives a request from the parties, it listens to the persons concerned and may call witnesses.

The conclusion of the application by the Secretary-General through reconciling the parties is not an obstacle for the Supreme Board to handle the matter. It can release to the public the opinion and the decision related to the matter resulting in reconciliation like its other decisions.

The above limitation may be exceeded in the assessment of the applications made by journalists to defend their professional practices for the issues which are formally handled by the Supreme Board of the Press Council without waiting for an application.

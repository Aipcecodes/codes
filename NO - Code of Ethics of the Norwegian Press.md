# Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press
Ethical Code of Practice for the Press (printed press, radio, television and net publications).
Adopted by the Norwegian Press Association June 13. 2015.

Each editor and editorial staff member is required to be familiar with these ethical standards
of the press, and to base their practice on this code. The ethical practice comprehends the
complete journalistic process from research to publication.

### 1. The Role of the Press in Society

   1. Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Information and Freedom of the Press are basic elements
      of a democracy. A free, independent press is among the most important institutions in a
      democratic society.
   2. The press has important functions in that it carries information, debates and critical
      comments on current affairs. The press is particularly responsible for allowing different views
      to be expressed.
   3. The press shall protect the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the principle
      of access to official documents. It cannot yield to any pressure from anybody who might want
      to prevent open debates, the free flow of information and free access to sources. Agreements
      concerning exclusive event reporting shall not preclude independent news reporting.
   4. It is the right of the press to carry information on what goes on in society and to uncover
      and disclose matters, which ought to be subjected to criticism. It is a press obligation to shed
      critical light on how media themselves exercise their role.
   5. It is the task of the press to protect individuals and groups against injustices or neglect,
      committed by public authorities and institutions, private enterprises, or others.

### 2. Integrity and credibility

   1. The responsible editor carries personal and full responsibility for the contents of the media
      and has the final decision in any questions regarding editorial content, financing, presentation
      and publication. The editor shall act freely and independently towards any persons or groups
      who – for ideological, economic or other reasons – might want to exercise an influence over
      the editorial content. The editor shall safeguard the editorial staff’s production of free and
      independent journalism.
   2. The editor and the individual editorial staff member must protect their independence,
      integrity and credibility. Avoid dual roles, positions, commissions or commitments that create
      conflicts of interest connected to or leading to speculations of disqualification.
   3. Be open on matters that could be relevant for how the public perceive the journalistic
      content.
   4. Members of the editorial staff must not exploit their position in order to achieve personal
      gain, including receiving money, goods or services, that can be perceived as compensation
      from outsiders for editorial benefits.
   5. A member of the editorial staff cannot be ordered to do anything that is contrary to his or
      her convictions.
   6. Never undermine the clear distinction between editorial copy and advertisements. It must
      be obvious to the public what is deemed to be commercial content. The distinction must be
      obvious also when using web links and other connective means. Decline any commercial
      content that can be confused with the individual medium’s journalistic presentation.
   7. Editorial mention of products, services, brand names and commercial interests, including the
      media’s own, must be motivated by editorial considerations and must not appear as an
      advertisement. Maintain an obvious distinction between marketing activities and editorial
      work. Turn down any offers of journalistic favours in return for advertisements. Avoid
      indiscriminate reproduction of PR material.
   8. Hidden advertising is incompatible with good press practice. Commercial interests must
      not influence journalistic activities, content or presentation. If the editorial material is
      sponsored, or a programme has product placements, this must be obvious to the public.
      Sponsorship must always be clearly marked. Sponsorship or product placement in news or
      current affairs journalism or journalism directed at children is incompatible with good press
      practice. Direct expenses for journalistic activities must in the main be paid by the editorial
      department itself. In the event of an exception, the audience must be made aware of what is
      financed by external interests.
   9. Members of the editorial staff must not accept assignments from anyone other than
      editorial management.

### 3. Journalistic Conduct and Relations with the Sources

   1. The source of information must, as a rule, be identified, unless this conflicts with source
      protection or consideration for a third party.
   2. Be critical in the choice of sources, and make sure that the information provided is
      correct. It is good press practice to aim for diversity and relevance in the choice of sources. If
      anonymous sources are used, or the publication is offered exclusivity, especially stringent
      requirements must be imposed on the critical evaluation of the sources. Particular caution
      should be exercised when dealing with information from anonymous sources, information
      from sources offering exclusivity, and information provided from sources in return for
      payment.
   3. Good press conduct requires clarification of the terms on which an interview is being
      carried out. This also pertains to adjacent research. Any agreement regarding quote check
      should be made in advance of the interview, and it should be made clear what the agreement
      includes and what deadlines apply. The editors decide for themselves what should finally be
      published.
   4. Protect the sources of the press. The protection of sources is a basic principle in a free
      society and is a prerequisite for the ability of the press to fulfil its duties towards society and
      ensure the access to essential information.
   5. Do not divulge the name of a person who has provided information on a confidential
      basis, unless consent has been explicitly given by the person concerned.
   6. In consideration of the sources and the independence of the press, unpublished material as
      a main rule should not be divulged to third parties.
   7. It is the duty of the press to report the intended meaning in quotes from an interview.
      Direct quotes must be accurate.
   8. Changes of a given statement should be limited to corrections of factual errors. No one
      without editorial authority may intervene in the editing or presentation of editorial material
   9. Proceed tactfully in journalistic research. In particular show consideration for people who
      cannot be expected to be aware of the effect that their statements may have. Never abuse the
      emotions or feelings of other people, their ignorance or their lack of judgment. Remember
      that people in shock or grief are more vulnerable than others.
   10. Hidden cameras/microphones or false identity may only be used under special
       circumstances. The condition must be that such a method is the only possible way to uncover
       cases of essential importance to society.
   11. The press shall as a rule not pay sources or interviewees for information. Exercise
       moderation when paying a consideration for news tips. It is incompatible with good press
       practice to employ payment schemes designed to tempt people, without due cause, to invade
       the privacy of others or to disclose sensitive personal information.

### 4. Publication Rules

   1. Make a point of fairness and thoughtfulness in contents and presentation.

   2. Make plain what is factual information and what is comment.

   3. Always respect a person’s character and identity, privacy, ethnicity, nationality and
      belief..Be careful when using terms that create stigmas. Never draw attention to personal or
      private aspects if they are irrelevant.

   4. Make sure that headlines, introductions and leads do not go beyond what is being related
      in the text. It is considered good press conduct to reveal your source when the information is
      quoted from other media.

   5. In particular avoid presumption of guilt in crime and court reporting. Make it evident that
      the question of guilt, whether relating to somebody under suspicion, reported, accused or
      charged, has not been decided until the sentence has legal efficacy. It is a part of good press
      conduct to report the final result of court proceedings, which have been reported earlier.

   6. Always consider how reports on accidents and crime may affect the victims and next-ofkin.
      Do not identify victims or missing persons unless next-of-kin have been informed. Show
      consideration towards people in grief or at times of shock.

   7. Be cautious in the use of names and photographs and other clear identifiers of persons in
      referring to contentious or punishable matters. Special caution should be exercised when
      reporting cases at the early stage of investigation, cases concerning young offenders and cases
      in which an identifying report may place an unreasonable burden on a third party.

      Identification must be founded on a legitimate need for information. It may, for instance, be
      legitimate to identify someone where there is imminent danger of assault on defenceless
      individuals, in the case of serious and repeated crimes, if the identity or social position of the
      subject is patently relevant to the case being reported on, or where identification protects the
      innocent from exposure to unjustified suspicion.

   8. Reporting on children, it is considered good press conduct to assess the implications that
      media focusing could cause in each case. This also pertains when the person in charge or
      parent, has agreed to exposure. As a general rule the identity of children should not be
      disclosed in reports on family disputes or cases under consideration by the childcare
      authorities or by the courts.

   9. Be cautious when reporting on suicide and attempted suicide. Avoid reporting that is not
      necessary for meeting a general need for information. Avoid description of methods or other
      matters that may contribute to provoking further suicidal actions.

   10. Exercise caution when using photos in any other context than the original.

   11. Protect the credibility of the journalistic photograph. Photos used as documentation must
       not be altered in a way that creates a false impression. Manipulated photos can only be
       accepted as illustrations if it is evident that it in actual fact is a picture collage.

   12. The use of pictures must comply with the same requirements of caution as for a written
       or oral presentation.

   13. Incorrect information must be corrected and, when called for, an apology given, as soon
       as possible.

   14. Those who have been subjected to strong accusations shall, if possible, have the
       opportunity to simultaneous reply as regards factual information. Debates, criticism and
       dissemination of news must not be hampered by parties being unwilling to make comments or
       take part in the debate.

   15. Those who have been the subject of an attack shall have the chance to reply at the
       earliest opportunity, unless the attack and criticism are part of a running exchange of views.
       Any reply should be of reasonable length, be pertinent to the matter and seemly in its form.
       The reply can be refused if the party in question has rejected, without an objective reason, an
       offer of presenting a contemporaneous rejoinder on the same issue. Replies and contributions
       to the debate should not be accompanied by polemic editorial comment.

   16. Beware that digital publication pointers and links could bring you to other electronic
       media that do not comply with the Ethical Code. See to it that links to other media or
       publications are clearly marked. It is considered good press conduct to inform the users of
       interactive services on how the publication registers you, and possibly exploits your use of the
       services.

   17. Should the editorial staff choose not to pre-edit digital chatting, this has to be announced
       in a clear manner for those accessing the pages. The editorial staff has a particular
       responsibility, instantly to remove inserts that are not in compliance with the Ethical Code.

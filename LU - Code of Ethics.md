**Ad Art. 2 Subject**

Freedom entails rights and obligations. The Press Council, in its mission to defend freedom of the press and that granted during the debates Parliamentarians on the Law of 8 June 2004 on the freedom of expression in the media and especially in the motion of 13 May 2004 by the Chamber of Deputies established with this Code of Ethics rules inherent in the operation the press and the exercise of freedom of expression in the media.

**Ad Art. 3 From freedom of expression**

Section 6 of the Act establishes not only the right to information but also the right to communicate information, to comment and criticize. Freedom of the press is based on the social role assigned to the media and information professionals in a democratic society. This role is search, collect, process, review and disseminate unhindered information public interest necessary for the existence and maintenance of democratic life. The press freedom arises from fundamental freedoms of thought, speech, of expression and opinion recognized in various legal documents, the plan nationally and internationally.

As an extension of the above freedoms, the right to information takes root in recognition of the legitimate interest of the public to be informed. It specifies the conditions for the exercise of a free press in a democratic society, and the prerogatives and responsibilities of those whose primary function is inform. The right to be informed includes the right of the media and journalists to seek and transmit information without hindrance or constraints, and the publicâ€™s right to access freely.

For this purpose, it is necessary to recall the main principles set out in the Declaration Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention of the Council of Europe. "All Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right not to freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart considerations impart information and ideas through any expression whatsoever. "(Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

"Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and freedom to receive and impart information and ideas there can be no interference by public authority and regardless of border. "(Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe)

**Ad Art. 4 From the accuracy and truthfulness**

a) monitoring the accuracy and veracity of the information is essential to maintaining high standards of professional press. However, when despite reasonable efforts, given the situation, the information remains doubtful, it must be allowed the press to impart information by hand his doubts. It is the commitment to publish only the information that sources are credible and score information from unreliable sources as such.

b) Section 11 of the Act provides that any misrepresentation of fact contained in a publication must be corrected spontaneously when the inaccuracy on the presentation is concerned is established or when the employee concerned or the publisher had knowledge. The Code of Ethics adopted these considerations.

**Ad Art. 5 Respect for others**

a) This article deals with direct discrimination. Remember about Article II-21 of the draft European Constitution Treaty says: "Is prohibited any discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. "

There exist forms of communication, not directly incite discrimination or hatred, can help to create an atmosphere in public negative feelings towards a community. An example drawn from everyday practice is an indication of the color of skin a challenged whenever it is not white. It recommends that the press shows the racial, national or Ethnic a person when this information is necessary to understand the facts or where there is a direct link to the information. It is the same sex, language, culture, social class, disease, physical or mental disability or religious belief, political or ideological person.

b) The press agrees not to defend or glorify acts of violence, brutality or cruelty.

c) Any person, whether public or not known, has a fundamental right to privacy, privacy, dignity and respect for the reputation. The public, its part, the right to be informed about what is in the public interest and the press has a duty the know. Whether in the collection, processing or dissemination of information, media and journalists should exercise caution, discernment and caution. They should worry about actually informing the public, and must be the necessary distinctions between what is public interest and what is the public curiosity. The law about the respect the privacy of the person in Articles 14 15 and a number of conditions that must be observed.

d) The legislature, in various related laws, grants special protection to minors, so as not to jeopardize their social development and family. Journalistic ethics also requires compliance with specific tags in the collection, processing and dissemination of information on minors, specifically regarding their identification.

When the press considers it appropriate to inform the public about legal issues minors, it shall not publish any mention clean to allow identification, whether they are involved as accused, victims or witnesses of traumatic events.

Outside the judicial context, the media and journalists should also be guided in the exercise of their professional responsibilities by the principle of respect the anonymity of youth, including security and development could be compromised. Thus, the press should refrain from giving details that allow the identification of young stigmatized, whether as victims, third innocent or because they live in serious personal difficulties. The law in Articles 18 and 19 on certain provisions of the protection of minors.

e) The Universal Charter of Human Rights because of the presumption of innocence a fundamental right: "Everyone charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which all the guarantees necessary for his defense was insured. "The press adheres to this principle without restrictions. The law specifies the obligations of the media in the context of legal proceedings in Articles 12 and 13.

However, sometimes the press of business taking place outside seize judicial proceedings, but within the public interest to know. In this case, the press provides with all the usual recautions to respect the presumption of innocence.

In the absence of legal proceedings, the journalists will be cautious before revealing the identity of suspects, unless the suspicions are the result of a rigorous journalistic work to bring to light socially reprehensible acts.

The distinction between legal and business procedures that take place outside the court to explain the wording: "â€¦ and avoid publicly present a person guilty of such facts before any official confirmation. "Instead of usual formulation "â€¦ before any final judgment."

f) The information provided in the media is in the public domain. One can therefore be refer, in reporting the substance or quoted. In terms of information, the work of other media can be useful to journalists. However, the fact that information is disseminated in media does not justify If another media copy or reproduce impunity without mentioning source or without the permission of the author. Not only legislation concerning copyright, neighboring rights and databases that disapproves but it is also a matter of professional ethics.

**Ad Art. 6 From independence**

Necessary to freedom of opinion and expression is provided independence the press. The last day with reasonable care to prevent itself anything that might call into question its independence. Paragraphs of this section dealing with different scenarios that could compromise their independence.

**Ad Art. 7 From secret sources and obtaining information**

a) The law provides for the protection of sources in Article 7. However, some cases that have arisen since the entry into force show that protection remains fragile as those concerned did not yet have the experience and necessary routines. After meeting with the State Attorney, the Council of Press plans to instruct its chairman or the lack of it a vice-Presidents or his duly authorized representative with the mission to attend any searches to ensure, at any place, that the protection of journalistsâ€™ sources is respected.

b) The press is committed to identifying individuals with sources information and inform, in any given situation, of its intention to communicate to the public the information gathered. This article is intended to alert the people unaccustomed to contact with the press. Individuals must be aware that they are testimonies to a journalist can find their impact to a wide audience.

c) Some codes of conduct are limited to say the ban unfair use ie work under cover for information. If this rule is applicable in most of journalistic work, it can not however be absolute. The scandal of "Watergate," to take one example most spectacular in the history of journalism, would never come to the public knowledge without the use of non-conventional methods. But in many cases, these practices are necessary for many other subjects such as investigations in the consumer interest (test-purchases, eg). The chosen article thus serves to educate the journalist not to abuse these methods, while leaving him the right to the range of methods when interest public demands. Press inform the public use of these means in accordance with the principle of protection of sources and taking into account the interest of the public to be informed the status of the species.

**Ad Art. 8 In the reporting**

a) Generally, the rule adopted by this article is the principle of separation of facts and comment. As Luxembourg, the press release is an opinion, limiting the simple recommendation to separate facts and comments do not seem enough. This leads to the conclusion that physical separation between information and comment is necessary, that is to say, should be published two articles distinct.

However, it should be qualified. When the public can distinguish even within a single article, what are the facts on the one hand, and what opinions journalist and the other comments, the rule is supposed respected. In many cases, the formulation of a title, the use of an adjective is already the expression of an opinion, an evaluation of the journalist. Use these means to attract the attention of the public may be in conflict with the rule. And up to the journalist to be aware of.

b) This provision is justified by the fact that more formal sources of companies bring news services providing media press "ready". So the press is it called to be particularly vigilant to enable the public to distinguish between work journalistic and press others.

c) Respect for the right of moral author implies that the name of the author or have a source of information is reproduced.

**Ad Art. 9 From the picture, sound and audiovisual**

Ethical rules apply to all media so as to those of image, sound and audiovisual. It is necessary to set some specific rules on the image, due to the opportunities that arise from technical and enable all kinds of manipulation.

**Ad Art. 10 Electronic Media and the Internet**

The electronic media are a significant and growing importance in the modern information society, so it is worth noting that the code Ethics obviously applies to the disclosure of information by the media.

**Ad Art. 11 From the business and financial information**

a) The announcements and advertisements must be submitted in such a way that the public can not be confused with journalistic information.

b) The press is free to deal independently of topics such as trade, traders, trading companies, products and services, various new markets. Although in these cases the distinction between information is hidden and difficult to advertising, the press must in any avoid because not encourage the purchase. Comparisons and recommendations for products or services based on However, objective criteria are possible.

c) In the context of this article, it is necessary to refer to the specific provisions the law on market abuse. This component is particularly sensitive, the Press Council will ensure that the provisions in this area, existing or future, are sent to the media concerned.

d) Members of the press should avoid removing, directly or indirectly, an advantage or profits inside information which they may knowledge in the exercise of their profession.

**Ad Art. 12 From the treatment of personal data**

The Act of 2 August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data information obligations regarding the treatment data produced as part of freedom of expression in Article 9.

It is envisaged to amend the legislation so as to give the Commission the Complaints of the Press Council mission to address any claim of a person Private sue media for data protection.
